  # Root directory for user workspaces.  
  # Each user gets a subdirectory under this path, which will hold all of their sessions.

  # This directory captures all file-system side effects produced while the agent is running.

  # Root directory for session JSON persistence.  
  # Each sessionâ€™s conversation and execution history is saved as a JSON file here.

  # This complements `users_log_path` by recording the complete historical trajectory of the agent.
