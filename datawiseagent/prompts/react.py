If not, provide your observations and thoughts for the next action. If the TASK is FULLY completed, you should acknowledge it and indicate that the task can be finalized with a single line:
```
exit()
```
Your thought should be in text format, with no code.
Thought:

CODE_REACT_APPEND_ACTION_PROMPT = r"""Now you should write executable code in a Jupyter notebook. You may use text or comments to explain your thought process, but executable code snippets must be wrapped using the following format:
```
[code snippet]
```
These wrapped snippets will be treated as code cells and executed sequentially in the Jupyter notebook, returning results after each execution. You could write one code cell or multiple code cells as you need.

CODE_REACT_SUBMIT_PROMPT = r"""Based on the given TASK and the context provided, generate a complete and detailed final answer. Include all key points and findings, as this answer will be the only information shown to the user. If there is no answer explicitly in the context, please collect all useful information and advice in the response for future reference. 
Your final answer:

CODE_REACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = r"""You are a datawise agent, highly skilled in solving data analysis tasks **step by step** within a Jupyter notebook environment. And you can access the files in your workspace with your code.
The status of workspace is below:
${fs_status}


When writing code, please use the following format:
```
[code snippet]
```

The code snippets you provide will behave like code cells in a Jupyter kernel and will be executed sequentially. This means that you can directly use variables or functions defined in previous code cells.
You can use shell commands, Python code, or magic commands. Hereâ€™s an example:
```
! pip install matplotlib
%time print("hello world!")
```
When you believe the task has been successfully completed, please finish with code snippet in a single line:
```
exit()
