{"id": 48, "name": "tabular-playground-series-may-2022", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nThe May edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground series binary classification problem includes a number of different feature interactions. This competition is an opportunity to explore various methods for identifying and exploiting these feature interactions.\n\nAbout the Tabular Playground Series\n\nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new to their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.\n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n\nGetting Started\n\nFor ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\nWe've also built a starter notebook for you that uses TensorFlow Decision Forests, a TensorFlow library that matches the power of XGBoost with a friendly, straightforward user interface.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nPhoto by Clarisse Croset on Unsplash.\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid, target\n900000, 0.65\n900001, 0.97\n900002, 0.02\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nFor this challenge, you are given (simulated) manufacturing control data and are tasked to predict whether the machine is in state 0 or state 1. The data has various feature interactions that may be important in determining the machine state. Good luck!\n\nFiles\n\n- train.csv: the training data, which includes normalized continuous data and categorical data\n- test.csv: the test set; your task is to predict the binary target variable which represents the state of a manufacturing process\n- sample_submission.csv: a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.\n\nIf you want to talk with other users about this competition, come join our Discord! We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here: https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the \"Join Competition\" button to create an account and gain access to the competition data. Then check out Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\nThe Challenge\n\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\nRecommended Tutorial\n\nWe highly recommend Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and this starter notebook to get started.\n\nOverview of How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n\nJoin the Competition\n\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n\nGet to Work\n\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n\nMake a Submission\n\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n\nCheck the Leaderboard\n\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard.\n\nImprove Your Score\n\nCheck out the discussion forum to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\nKaggle Lingo Video\n\nYou may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out Dr. Rachael Tatman’s video on Kaggle Lingo to get up to speed!\n\nWhat Data Will I Use in This Competition?\n\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv. Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes. Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.\n\nCheck out the “Data” tab to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\nHow to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\n\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\nClick on the “Submit Predictions” button\n\nUpload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n\nSubmission File Format:\n\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n\nPassengerId (sorted in any order)\nSurvived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\nGot it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n\nFor Competition Help: Titanic Discussion Forum\nTechnical Help: Kaggle Contact Us Page\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\nA Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\n\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data & code. In every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks here.\n\n🏃‍♀️Ready to Compete? Join the Competition Here!\n\nEvaluation\n\nGoal\n\nIt is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.\n\nMetric\n\nYour score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as accuracy.\n\nSubmission File Format\n\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\nPassengerId (sorted in any order)\nSurvived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\nPassengerId,Survived\n892,0\n893,1\n894,0\nEtc.\n\nYou can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the Data page.\n\nDataset Description\n\nOverview\n\nThe data has been split into two groups:\ntraining set (train.csv)\ntest set (test.csv)\n\nThe training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nWe also include gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.\n\nData Dictionary\n\nVariable Definition Key\n\nsurvival: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\npclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)\nsex: Sex\nAge: Age in years\nsibsp: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic\nparch: # of parents / children aboard the Titanic\nticket: Ticket number\nfare: Passenger fare\ncabin: Cabin number\nembarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)\n\nVariable Notes\n\npclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n1st = Upper\n2nd = Middle\n3rd = Lower\n\nage: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, it is in the form of xx.5\n\nsibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\nSibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister\nSpouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)\n\nparch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\nParent = mother, father\nChild = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson\nSome children traveled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the training and test datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and summary statistics of the training dataset\ntrain_df.info()\ntrain_df.describe()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and summary statistics of the test dataset\ntest_df.info()\ntest_df.describe()\n```\nTime consumed: 0.09s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n   PassengerId  Survived  Pclass                                Name     Sex  \\\n0          332         0       1                 Partner, Mr. Austen    male   \n1          734         0       2          Berriman, Mr. William John    male   \n2          383         0       3                  Tikkanen, Mr. Juho    male   \n3          705         0       3             Hansen, Mr. Henrik Juul    male   \n4          814         0       3  Andersson, Miss.

The process was carried out in several key steps:\n\n1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: \n   - Loaded the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n   - Identified missing values and categorical variables that required preprocessing.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing**:\n   - Handled missing values by filling them with appropriate statistics (e.g., median for `Age` and `Fare`, mode for `Embarked`).\n   - Dropped the `Cabin` column due to a large number of missing values.\n   - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling.\n\n3. **Model Training**:\n   - Implemented a RandomForestClassifier to predict passenger survival.\n   - Split the training data into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.\n   - Achieved an accuracy score of approximately 79.7% on the validation set.\n\n4. **Robust Workflow Implementation**:\n   - Created a separate Python script for model training, which checks for an existing pre-trained model and logs the model accuracy.\n   - Ensured that all training scripts, models, and experiment logs are stored in the `./input/` folder for permanent storage.\n\n5. **Prediction and Submission**:\n   - Used the trained model to predict the survival of passengers in the test dataset.\n   - Saved the predictions in the required submission format as `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n\nThe final submission file is ready for evaluation on Kaggle. This workflow ensures efficient use of resources and handles potential kernel disconnections by leveraging model persistence and modularizing the training process.\n```\n", "session_id": "a36eb3b9-e485-4b70-8716-c009161e19ad", "user_id": "74eb76a3-665d-4b1a-9a3c-2bf18d4363fb", "time": 54.405219316482544, "cost": null, "model": "gpt-4o", "input": null, "output": null, "result_path": "../log/workspace/users/74eb76a3-665d-4b1a-9a3c-2bf18d4363fb/a36eb3b9-e485-4b70-8716-c009161e19ad/input/final_submission.csv"}

We are always looking for ways to help our customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals. Our data science team is continually challenging our machine learning algorithms, working with the global data science community to make sure we can more accurately identify new ways to solve our most common challenge, binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan? \n\nIn this challenge, we invite Kagglers to help us identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem.\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target. \n\nSubmission File  \nFor each Id in the test set, you must make a binary prediction of the target variable.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nNothing ruins the thrill of buying a brand new car more quickly than seeing your new insurance bill. The sting’s even more painful when you know you’re a good driver. It doesn’t seem fair that you have to pay so much if you’ve been cautious on the road for years. Porto Seguro, one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies, completely agrees. Inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones. \nIn this competition, you’re challenged to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. While Porto Seguro has used machine learning for the past 20 years, they’re looking to Kaggle’s machine learning community to explore new, more powerful methods. A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.\n\nEvaluation  \nScoring Metric  \nSubmissions are evaluated using the Normalized Gini Coefficient. During scoring, observations are sorted from the largest to the smallest predictions. Predictions are only used for ordering observations; therefore, the relative magnitude of the predictions is not used during scoring. The scoring algorithm then compares the cumulative proportion of positive class observations to a theoretical uniform proportion. \nThe Gini Coefficient ranges from approximately 0 for random guessing to approximately 0.5 for a perfect score. The theoretical maximum for the discrete calculation is (1 - frac_pos) / 2.\nThe Normalized Gini Coefficient adjusts the score by the theoretical maximum so that the maximum score is 1. \nThe code to calculate the Normalized Gini Coefficient in a number of different languages can be found in this forum thread. \n\nSubmission File  \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a probability of an insurance claim in the target column. The file should contain a header and have the following format: \n\n```\nid,target \n0,0.1 \n1,0.9 \n2,1.0 \netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nData Description  \nIn this competition, you will predict the probability that an auto insurance policyholder files a claim. In the train and test data, features that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the feature names (e.g., ind, reg, car, calc). In addition, feature names include the postfix bin to indicate binary features and cat to indicate categorical features. Features without these designations are either continuous or ordinal. Values of -1 indicate that the feature was missing from the observation. The target column signifies whether or not a claim was filed for that policyholder.\n\nFile descriptions\n\n- `train.csv` contains the training data, where each row corresponds to a policyholder, and the target column signifies that a claim was filed.\n- `test.csv` contains the test data.\n- `sample_submission.csv` is the submission file showing the correct format.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and

dataset contains 476,169 rows and 59 columns, while the test dataset contains 119,043 rows and 58 columns.\n- There are no missing values in either the training or test datasets.\n- The target variable in the training dataset is binary, indicating whether a claim was filed.\n- Features are a mix of binary, categorical, and continuous/ordinal types, with some features having missing values indicated by -1.\n\nNext, we will proceed to data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling if necessary.\n```\n```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features if necessary.\n```\n```markdown\n# Preprocessing Summary\nThe preprocessing step involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling continuous features. The following steps were taken:\n- Missing values indicated by `-1` were replaced with `NaN`.\n- Categorical variables were encoded using `LabelEncoder` after converting all values to strings to ensure uniform data types.\n- Continuous features were scaled using `StandardScaler`.\n\nThe datasets are now ready for model training.\n```\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler\n\n# Handle missing values by replacing -1 with NaN\ntrain_df.replace(-1, pd.NA, inplace=True)\ntest_df.replace(-1, pd.NA, inplace=True)\n\n# Convert categorical columns to strings before encoding\ncat_features = [col for col in train_df.columns if 'cat' in col]\nfor col in cat_features:\n    train_df[col] = train_df[col].astype(str)\n    test_df[col] = test_df[col].astype(str)\n\n# Encode categorical variables\nfor col in cat_features:\n    le = LabelEncoder()\n    train_df[col] = le.fit_transform(train_df[col])\n    test_df[col] = le.transform(test_df[col])\n\n# Scale continuous features\ncont_features = [col for col in train_df.columns if 'calc' in col or 'ind' in col or 'reg' in col]\nscaler = StandardScaler()\ntrain_df[cont_features] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df[cont_features])\ntest_df[cont_features] = scaler.transform(test_df[cont_features])\n\n# Verify preprocessing\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Verify preprocessing on test data\ntest_df.head()\n```\nTime consumed: 3.73s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 1\nOutput: ERROR: ERROR: TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a real number, not 'NAType'\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n/tmp/ipykernel_645/3445505615.py in ?()\n     18 \n     19 #

What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.  \nSantander Bank is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.  \nIn this competition, you'll work with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.  \n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.  \n\nSubmission File  \nFor each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the TARGET variable.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription:\n\nAccording to Epsilon research, 80% of customers are more likely to do business with you if you provide personalized service. Banking is no exception. The digitalization of everyday lives means that customers expect services to be delivered in a personalized and timely manner… and often before they´ve even realized they need the service.\n\nIn their 3rd Kaggle competition, Santander Group aims to go a step beyond recognizing that there is a need to provide a customer a financial service and intends to determine the amount or value of the customer's transaction. This means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, but also simple and personal way. With so many choices for financial services, this need is greater now than ever before.\n\nIn this competition, Santander Group is asking Kagglers to help them identify the value of transactions for each potential customer. This is a first step that Santander needs to nail in order to personalize their services at scale.\n\nEvaluation:\n\nThe evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error. The RMSLE is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\log(p_i + 1) - \\log(a_i + 1))^2 }\n\\]\nWhere:\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is the RMSLE value (score),\n\\(n\\) is the total number of observations in the (public/private) data set,\n\\(p_i\\) is your prediction of target, and\n\\(a_i\\) is the actual target for \\(i\\).\n\\(\\log(x)\\) is the natural logarithm of \\(x\\).\n\nSubmission File:\n\nFor every row in the test.csv, submission files should contain two columns: ID and target. The ID corresponds to the column of that ID in the test.tsv. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nID,target\n000137c73,5944923.322036332\n00021489f,5944923.322036332\n0004d7953,5944923.322036332\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description:\n\nYou are provided with an anonymized dataset containing numeric feature variables, the numeric target column, and a string ID column. The task is to predict the value of the target column in the test set.\n\nFile descriptions:\n- train.csv - the training set\n- test.csv - the test set\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nCan machine learning identify the appropriate reading level of a passage of text and help inspire learning? Reading is an essential skill for academic success. When students have access to engaging passages offering the right level of challenge, they naturally develop reading skills.\n\nCurrently, most educational texts are matched to readers using traditional readability methods or commercially available formulas. However, each has its issues. Tools like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level are based on weak proxies of text decoding (i.e., characters or syllables per word) and syntactic complexity (i.e., number of words per sentence). As a result, they lack construct and theoretical validity. At the same time, commercially available formulas, such as Lexile, can be cost-prohibitive, lack suitable validation studies, and suffer from transparency issues when the formula's features aren't publicly available.\n\nCommonLit, Inc., is a nonprofit education technology organization serving over 20 million teachers and students with free digital reading and writing lessons for grades 3-12. Together with Georgia State University, an R1 public research university in Atlanta, they are challenging Kagglers to improve readability rating methods.\n\nIn this competition, you’ll build algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, you'll pair your machine learning skills with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains. Winning models will be sure to incorporate text cohesion and semantics.\n\nIf successful, you'll aid administrators, teachers, and students. Literacy curriculum developers and teachers who choose passages will be able to quickly and accurately evaluate works for their classrooms. Plus, these formulas will become more accessible for all. Perhaps most importantly, students will benefit from feedback on the complexity and readability of their work, making it far easier to improve essential reading skills.\n\nAcknowledgements  \nCommonLit would like to extend a special thanks to Professor Scott Crossley's research team at the Georgia State University Departments of Applied Linguistics and Learning Sciences for their partnership on this project. The organizers would like to thank Schmidt Futures for their advice and support for making this work possible.\n\nThis is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as: \n\\[ \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} \\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the predicted value, \\(y\\) is the original value, and \\(n\\) is the number of rows in the test data.\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each row in the test set, you must predict the value of the target as described on the data tab, each on a separate row in the submission file. The file should contain a header and have the following format: \n```\nid,target \neaf8e7355,0.0 \n60ecc9777,0.5 \nc0f722661,-2.0 \netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description  \nIn this competition, we're predicting the reading ease of excerpts from literature. We've provided excerpts from several time periods and a wide range of reading ease scores. Note that the test set includes a slightly larger proportion of modern texts (the type of texts we want to generalize to) than the training set.\n\nAlso note that while licensing information is provided for the public test set (because the associated excerpts are available for display/use), the hidden private test set includes only blank license/legal information.\n\nFiles  \n- train.csv - the training set\n- test.csv - the test set\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns  \n- id - unique ID for excerpt\n- url_legal - URL of source - this is blank in the test set.\n- license - license of source material - this is blank in the test set.\n- excerpt - text to predict reading ease of\n- target - reading ease\n- standard_error - measure of spread of scores among multiple raters for each excerpt. Not included for test data.\n\nUpdate  \nThis dataset, the CLEAR Corpus, has now been released in full. You may obtain it from either of the following locations:\n- commonlit.org\n- github.com\n\nThe full corpus contains an expanded set of fields as well as six readability predictions on each excerpt resulting from this competition.\n\nYou may read more about the CLEAR Corpus from the following publications:\n- Crossley, S.

Paris, France. [link]\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`.

{"id": 8, "name": "bike-sharing-demand", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nGet started on this competition through Kaggle Scripts.\n\nBike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.\n\nThe data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed are explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nKaggle is hosting this competition for the machine learning community to use for fun and practice. This dataset was provided by Hadi Fanaee Tork using data from Capital Bikeshare. We also thank the UCI machine learning repository for hosting the dataset. If you use the problem in publication, please cite:\nFanaee-T, Hadi, and Gama, Joao, \"Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge,\" Progress in Artificial Intelligence (2013): pp. 1-15, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). The RMSLE is calculated as: \n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\log(p_i + 1) - \\log(a_i + 1))^2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(n\\) is the number of hours in the test set\n- \\(p_i\\) is your predicted count\n- \\(a_i\\) is the actual count\n- \\(\\log(x)\\) is the natural logarithm \n\nSubmission Format\n\nYour submission file must have a header and should be structured in the following format:\n```\ndatetime,count\n2011-01-20 00:00:00,0\n2011-01-20 01:00:00,0\n2011-01-20 02:00:00,0\n...\n...\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nSee, fork, and run a random forest benchmark model through Kaggle Scripts. You are provided hourly rental data spanning two years. For this competition, the training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month. You must predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.\n\nData Fields\n- `datetime`: hourly date + timestamp\n- `season`: 1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter\n- `holiday`: whether the day is considered a holiday\n- `workingday`: whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday\n- `weather`:\n  1. Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy\n  2. Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist\n  3. Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds\n  4. Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog\n- `temp`: temperature in Celsius\n- `atemp`: \"feels like\" temperature in Celsius\n- `humidity`: relative humidity\n- `windspeed`: wind speed\n- `casual`: number of non-registered user rentals initiated\n- `registered`: number of registered user rentals initiated\n- `count`: number of total rentals\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nGoal of the Competition\n\nThe goal of this competition is to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). Utilizing a dataset of essays written by ELLs will help to develop proficiency models that better support all students. Your work will help ELLs receive more accurate feedback on their language development and expedite the grading cycle for teachers. These outcomes could enable ELLs to receive more appropriate learning tasks that will help them improve their English language proficiency.\n\nContext\n\nWriting is a foundational skill. Sadly, it's one few students are able to hone, often because writing tasks are infrequently assigned in school. A rapidly growing student population, students learning English as a second language, known as English Language Learners (ELLs), are especially affected by the lack of practice. While automated feedback tools make it easier for teachers to assign more writing tasks, they are not designed with ELLs in mind. Existing tools are unable to provide feedback based on the language proficiency of the student, resulting in a final evaluation that may be skewed against the learner. Data science may be able to improve automated feedback tools to better support the unique needs of these learners.\n\nCompetition host\n\nVanderbilt University is a private research university in Nashville, Tennessee. It offers 70 undergraduate majors and a full range of graduate and professional degrees across 10 schools and colleges, all on a beautiful campus—an accredited arboretum—complete with athletic facilities and state-of-the-art laboratories. Vanderbilt is optimized to inspire and nurture cross-disciplinary research that fosters discoveries that have global impact. Vanderbilt and co-host, The Learning Agency Lab, an independent nonprofit based in Arizona, are focused on developing science of learning-based tools and programs for social good. Vanderbilt and The Learning Agency Lab have partnered together to offer data scientists the opportunity to support ELLs using data science skills in machine learning, natural language processing, and educational data analytics. You can improve automated feedback tools for ELLs by sensitizing them to language proficiency. The resulting tools could serve teachers by alleviating the grading burden and support ELLs by ensuring their work is evaluated within the context of their current language level.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nVanderbilt University and the Learning Agency Lab would like to thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for their support in making this work possible.\n\nThis is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are scored using MCRMSE, mean columnwise root mean squared error:\n\\[ \\textrm{MCRMSE} = \\frac{1}{N_{t}}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{t}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{ij} - \\hat{y}_{ij})^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( N_t \\) is the number of scored ground truth target columns, and \\( y \\) and \\( \\hat{y} \\) are the actual and predicted values, respectively.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each text_id in the test set, you must predict a value for each of the six analytic measures (described on the Data page). The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\ntext_id,cohesion,syntax,vocabulary,phraseology,grammar,conventions  \n0000C359D63E,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0  \n000BAD50D026,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0  \n00367BB2546B,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0  \n003969F4EDB6,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0  \n...\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset presented here (the ELLIPSE corpus) comprises argumentative essays written by 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). The essays have been scored according to six analytic measures: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions. Each measure represents a component of proficiency in essay writing, with greater scores corresponding to greater proficiency in that measure. The scores range from 1.0 to 5.0 in increments of 0.5. Your task is to predict the score of each of the six measures for the essays given in the test set. Some of these essays have appeared in the datasets for the Feedback Prize - Evaluating Student Writing and Feedback Prize - Predicting Effective Arguments competitions. You are welcome to make use of these earlier datasets in this competition.\n\nFile and Field Information\n\n- train.csv - The training set, comprising the full_text of each essay, identified by a unique text_id. The essays are also given a score for each of the six analytic measures above: cohesion, etc. These analytic measures comprise the target for the competition.\n- test.csv - For the test data we give only the full_text of an essay together with its text_id.\n- sample_submission.csv - A submission file in the correct format. See the Evaluation page for details.\n\nPlease note that this is a Code Competition. We give a few sample essays in test.csv to help you author your solutions. When your submission is scored, this example test data will be replaced with the full test set. The full test set comprises about 2700 essays.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nThink you can use your data science skills to make big predictions at a submicroscopic level? Many diseases, including cancer, are believed to have a contributing factor in common. Ion channels are pore-forming proteins present in animals and plants. They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. If scientists could better study ion channels, which may be possible with the aid of machine learning, it could have a far-reaching impact.\n\nWhen ion channels open, they pass electric currents. Existing methods of detecting these state changes are slow and laborious. Humans must supervise the analysis, which imparts considerable bias, in addition to being tedious. These difficulties limit the volume of ion channel current analysis that can be used in research. Scientists hope that technology could enable rapid automatic detection of ion channel current events in raw data.  \nThe University of Liverpool’s Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease is working to advance ion channel research. Their team of scientists have asked for your help. In this competition, you’ll use ion channel data to better model automatic identification methods. If successful, you’ll be able to detect individual ion channel events in noisy raw signals. The data is simulated and injected with real-world noise to emulate what scientists observe in laboratory experiments.\n\nTechnology to analyze electrical data in cells has not changed significantly over the past 20 years. If we better understand ion channel activity, the research could impact many areas related to cell health and migration. From human diseases to how climate change affects plants, faster detection of ion channels could greatly accelerate solutions to major world problems.  \nAcknowledgements:  \nThis would not be possible without the help of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC).\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated using the macro F1 score.  \nF1 is calculated as follows:  \n\\[ F_1 = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{precision} \\times \\text{recall}}{\\text{precision} + \\text{recall}} \\]\nwhere:  \n\\[ \\text{precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\]  \n\\[ \\text{recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} \\]  \nIn \"macro\" F1, a separate F1 score is calculated for each open_channels value and then averaged.  \n\nSubmission File  \nFor each time value in the test set, you must predict open_channels. The files must have a header and should look like the following:\n```\ntime, open_channels \n500.0000, 0 \n500.0001, 2 \n...\n```\n\nDataset Description  \nIn this competition, you will be predicting the number of open_channels present, based on electrophysiological signal data.  \nIMPORTANT:  \nWhile the time series appears continuous, the data is from discrete batches of 50 seconds long 10 kHz samples (500,000 rows per batch). In other words, the data from 0.0001 - 50.0000 is a different batch than 50.0001 - 100.0000, and thus discontinuous between 50.0000 and 50.0001.

This resulted in missing values when attempting to merge the test dataset with the sample submission file, leading to errors during data preprocessing and prediction.\n\n### Debugging Attempts\n1. **Data Inspection**: \n   - Verified the structure and contents of the training and test datasets.\n   - Checked the unique IDs in both the test dataset and the sample submission file to identify discrepancies.\n\n2. **Data Merging**:\n   - Attempted to merge the test dataset with the sample submission file to align the IDs.\n   - Encountered missing values in the merged dataset, indicating that the test dataset was incomplete or not correctly aligned with the sample submission file.\n\n3. **Handling Missing Values**:\n   - Tried to fill missing values in the categorical column 'Sex' with the most frequent value and numerical columns with the mean.\n   - Encountered errors due to the absence of data in the merged dataset, leading to failures in filling missing values and preprocessing.\n\n### Insights\n- The test dataset provided does not match the expected number of rows and IDs as indicated by the sample submission file. This suggests that the test dataset is incomplete or not the correct one for this task.\n- The merge operation did not correctly align the test dataset with the sample submission file, resulting in an entirely missing dataset after merging.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe debugging process was unable to resolve the issue due to the fundamental mismatch between the test dataset and the sample submission file. To proceed, it is necessary to obtain the correct test dataset that matches the sample submission file in terms of IDs and structure. Once the correct dataset is available, the data preprocessing and prediction steps can be re-attempted.\n```\n```markdown\n# Submission File Verification\nThe submission file format has been verified against the sample submission file.

{"id": 13, "name": "ventilator-pressure-prediction", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nWhat do doctors do when a patient has trouble breathing? They use a ventilator to pump oxygen into a sedated patient's lungs via a tube in the windpipe. But mechanical ventilation is a clinician-intensive procedure, a limitation that was prominently on display during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators is prohibitively expensive, even before reaching clinical trials. High-quality simulators could reduce this barrier.\n\nCurrent simulators are trained as an ensemble, where each model simulates a single lung setting. However, lungs and their attributes form a continuous space, so a parametric approach must be explored that would consider the differences in patient lungs.\n\nPartnering with Princeton University, the team at Google Brain aims to grow the community around machine learning for mechanical ventilation control. They believe that neural networks and deep learning can better generalize across lungs with varying characteristics than the current industry standard of PID controllers.\n\nIn this competition, you’ll simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient's lung. The best submissions will take lung attributes compliance and resistance into account.\n\nIf successful, you'll help overcome the cost barrier of developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators. This will pave the way for algorithms that adapt to patients and reduce the burden on clinicians during these novel times and beyond. As a result, ventilator treatments may become more widely available to help patients breathe.\n\nPhoto by Nino Liverani on Unsplash\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe competition will be scored as the mean absolute error between the predicted and actual pressures during the inspiratory phase of each breath. The expiratory phase is not scored. The score is given by:\n|𝑋−𝑌| \nwhere 𝑋 is the vector of predicted pressure and 𝑌 is the vector of actual pressures across all breaths in the test set.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a value for the pressure variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nid,pressure\n1,20\n2,23\n3,24\n```\netc.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe ventilator data used in this competition was produced using a modified open-source ventilator connected to an artificial bellows test lung via a respiratory circuit. The diagram below illustrates the setup, with the two control inputs highlighted in green and the state variable (airway pressure) to predict in blue. \n\nThe first control input is a continuous variable from 0 to 100 representing the percentage the inspiratory solenoid valve is open to let air into the lung (i.e., 0 is completely closed and no air is let in and 100 is completely open). The second control input is a binary variable representing whether the exploratory valve is open (1) or closed (0) to let air out.\n\nIn this competition, participants are given numerous time series of breaths and will learn to predict the airway pressure in the respiratory circuit during the breath, given the time series of control inputs.\n\nEach time series represents an approximately 3-second breath. The files are organized such that each row is a time step in a breath and gives the two control signals, the resulting airway pressure, and relevant attributes of the lung, described below.\n\nFiles\n- train.csv: the training set\n- test.csv: the test set\n- sample_submission.csv: a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns\n- id: globally-unique time step identifier across an entire file\n- breath_id: globally-unique time step for breaths\n- R: lung attribute indicating how restricted the airway is (in cmH2O/L/S). Physically, this is the change in pressure per change in flow (air volume per time). Intuitively, one can imagine blowing up a balloon through a straw. We can change R by changing the diameter of the straw, with higher R being harder to blow.\n- C: lung attribute indicating how compliant the lung is (in mL/cmH2O). Physically, this is the change in volume per change in pressure. Intuitively, one can imagine the same balloon example. We can change C by changing the thickness of the balloon’s latex, with higher C having thinner latex and easier to blow.\n- time_step: the actual time stamp.\n- u_in: the control input for the inspiratory solenoid valve. Ranges from 0 to 100.\n- u_out: the control input for the exploratory solenoid valve. Either 0 or 1.\n- pressure: the airway pressure measured in the respiratory circuit, measured in cmH2O.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nThe malware industry continues to be a well-organized, well-funded market dedicated to evading traditional security measures. Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways. With more than one billion enterprise and consumer customers, Microsoft takes this problem very seriously and is deeply invested in improving security.\n\nAs one part of their overall strategy for doing so, Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. As with their previous Malware Challenge (2015), Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences. Can you help protect more than one billion machines from damage BEFORE it happens?\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis competition is hosted by Microsoft, Windows Defender ATP Research, Northeastern University College of Computer and Information Science, and Georgia Tech Institute for Information Security & Privacy.\n\nMicrosoft contacts:\n- Rob McCann (Robert.McCann@microsoft.com)\n- Christian Seifert (chriseif@microsoft.com)\n- Susan Higgs (Susan.Higgs@microsoft.com)\n- Matt Duncan (Matthew.Duncan@microsoft.com)\n\nNortheastern University contact:\n- Mansour Ahmadi (m.ahmadi@northeastern.edu)\n\nGeorgia Tech contacts:\n- Brendan Saltaformaggio (brendan@ece.gatech.edu)\n- Taesoo Kim (taesoo@gatech.edu)\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed label.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each MachineIdentifier in the test set, you must predict a probability for the HasDetections column. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nMachineIdentifier, HasDetections\n1, 0.5\n6, 0.5\n14, 0.5\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe goal of this competition is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender.\n\nEach row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineIdentifier. HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for HasDetections for each machine in test.csv.\n\nThe sampling methodology used to create this dataset was designed to meet certain business constraints, both in regards to user privacy as well as the time period during which the machine was running. Malware detection is inherently a time-series problem, but it is made complicated by the introduction of new machines, machines that come online and offline, machines that receive patches, machines that receive new operating systems, etc. While the dataset provided here has been roughly split by time, the complications and sampling requirements mentioned above may mean you may see imperfect agreement between your cross-validation, public, and private scores! Additionally, this dataset is not representative of Microsoft customers’ machines in the wild; it has been sampled to include a much larger proportion of malware machines.\n\nColumns\n\nUnavailable or self-documenting column names are marked with an \"NA\".\n\n- MachineIdentifier - Individual machine ID\n- ProductName - Defender state information e.g. win8defender\n- EngineVersion - Defender state information e.g. 1.1.12603.0\n- AppVersion - Defender state information e.g. 4.9.10586.0\n- AvSigVersion - Defender state information e.g. 1.217.1014.0\n- IsBeta - Defender state information e.g. false\n- RtpStateBitfield - NA\n- IsSxsPassiveMode - NA\n- DefaultBrowsersIdentifier - ID for the machine's default browser\n- AVProductStatesIdentifier - ID for the specific configuration of a user's antivirus software\n- AVProductsInstalled - NA\n- AVProductsEnabled - NA\n- HasTpm - True if the machine has TPM\n- CountryIdentifier - ID for the country the machine is located in\n- CityIdentifier - ID for the city the machine is located in\n- OrganizationIdentifier - ID for the organization the machine belongs in, organization ID is mapped to both specific companies and broad industries\n- GeoNameIdentifier - ID for the geographic region a machine is located in\n- LocaleEnglishNameIdentifier - English name of Locale ID of the current user\n- Platform - Calculates platform name (of OS-related properties and processor property)\n- Processor - This is the process architecture of the installed operating system\n- OsVer - Version of the current operating system\n- OsBuild - Build of the current operating system\n- OsSuite - Product suite mask for the current operating system\n- OsPlatformSubRelease - Returns the OS Platform sub-release (Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, TH1, TH2)\n- OsBuildLab - Build lab that generated the current OS.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\n📣 Recommended Competition\nWe highly recommend Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster to get familiar with the basics of machine learning and Kaggle competitions.\n\nWelcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.\n\nThe Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.\n\nWhile rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!\n\nTo help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.\n\nHelp save them and change history!\n\n💡 Getting Started Notebook\nTo get started quickly, feel free to take advantage of this starter notebook.\n\nIf you want to talk with other users about this competition, come join our Discord! We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists.

To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.\n\nFile and Data Field Descriptions\n\ntrain.csv\n- Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.\n  - PassengerId: A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form `gggg_pp` where `gggg` indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and `pp` is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\n  - HomePlanet: The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\n  - CryoSleep: Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\n  - Cabin: The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form `deck/num/side`, where `side` can be either `P` for Port or `S` for Starboard.\n  - Destination: The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\n  - Age: The age of the passenger.\n  - VIP: Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\n  - RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck: Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\n  - Name: The first and last names of the passenger.\n  - Transported: Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.\n\ntest.csv\n- Personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data. Your task is to predict the value of Transported for the passengers in this set.\n\nsample_submission.csv\n- A submission file in the correct format.\n  - PassengerId: Id for each passenger in the test set.\n  - Transported: The target. For each passenger, predict either True or False.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the training and test datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the training dataset\ntrain_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the test dataset\ntest_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the training dataset\ntrain_df.isnull().sum()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the test dataset\ntest_df.isnull().sum()\n```\nTime consumed: 0.08s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n  PassengerId HomePlanet CryoSleep     Cabin  Destination   Age    VIP  \\\n0     2513_01      Earth     False       NaN  TRAPPIST-1e  28.0  False   \n1     2774_02      Earth     False   F/575/P  TRAPPIST-1e  17.0  False   \n2     8862_04     Europa      True   C/329/S  55 Cancri e  28.0  False   \n3     8736_02       Mars     False  F/1800/P  TRAPPIST-1e  20.0  False   \n4     0539_02     Europa      True    C/18/P  55 Cancri e  36.0  False   \n\n   RoomService  FoodCourt  ShoppingMall    Spa  VRDeck               Name  \\\n0          0.0       55.0           0.0  656.0     0.0     Loree Mathison   \n1          0.0     1195.0          31.0    0.0     0.0  Crisey Mcbriddley   \n2          0.0        0.0           0.0    0.0     0.0     Alramix Myling   \n3          NaN        2.0         289.0  976.0     0.0          Tros Pota   \n4          0.0        0.0           0.0    0.0     0.0     Achyon Nalanet   \n\n   Transported  \n0        False  \n1        False  \n2         True  \n3         True  \n4         True  \nTime consumed: 0.06s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n  PassengerId HomePlanet CryoSleep     Cabin  Destination   Age    VIP  \\\n0     0337_02       Mars     False    F/63/S  TRAPPIST-1e  19.0  False   \n1     2891_01      Earth     False   G/460/S  TRAPPIST-1e  18.0  False   \n2     8998_01      Earth      True  G/1449/S  TRAPPIST-1e  41.0  False   \n3     1771_01      Earth     False   G/291/P  TRAPPIST-1e  35.0  False   \n4     9034_02     Europa      True   D/288/P  TRAPPIST-1e  43.0  False   \n\n   RoomService  FoodCourt  ShoppingMall  Spa  VRDeck                Name  \n0        417.0      349.0         634.0  3.0  1057.0         Weros Perle  \n1          4.0      904.0           0.0  0.0     1.0  Gleney Ortinericey  \n2          0.0        0.0           0.0  0.0     0.0      Gerry Englence  \n3          0.0      338.0         436.0  NaN     0.0      Antone Cardner  \n4          0.0        0.0           0.0  0.0     0.0     Errairk Crakete  \nTime consumed: 0.07s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 6954 entries, 0 to 6953\nData columns (total 14 columns):\n #

{"id": 16, "name": "dont-overfit-ii", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nLong ago, in the distant, fragrant mists of time, there was a competition… It was not just any competition. It was a competition that challenged mere mortals to model a 20,000x200 matrix of continuous variables using only 250 training samples… without overfitting. Data scientists ― including Kaggle's very own Will Cukierski ― competed by the hundreds. Legends were made. (Will took 5th place, and eventually ended up working at Kaggle!) People overfit like crazy. It was a Kaggle-y, data science-y madhouse. \n\nSo… we're doing it again.  \nDon't Overfit II: The Overfittening  \nThis is the next logical step in the evolution of weird competitions. Once again we have 20,000 rows of continuous variables, and a mere handful of training samples. Once again, we challenge you not to overfit. Do your best, model without overfitting, and add, perhaps, to your own legend. In addition to bragging rights, the winner also gets swag. Enjoy!  \n\nAcknowledgments  \nWe hereby salute the hard work that went into the original competition, created by Phil Brierly. Thank you!\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated using AUC ROC between the predicted target and the actual target value.  \n\nSubmission File  \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target variable.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\n\"My ridiculous dog is amazing.\" [sentiment: positive]\n\nWith all of the tweets circulating every second, it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact a company’s or a person's brand by being viral (positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. But which words actually lead to the sentiment description? In this competition, you will need to pick out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment.\n\nHelp build your skills in this important area with this broad dataset of tweets. Work on your technique to grab a top spot in this competition. What words in tweets support a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment? How can you help make that determination using machine learning tools?\n\nIn this competition we've extracted support phrases from Figure Eight's Data for Everyone platform. The dataset is titled Sentiment Analysis: Emotion in Text tweets with existing sentiment labels, used here under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence. Your objective in this competition is to construct a model that can do the same - look at the labeled sentiment for a given tweet and figure out what word or phrase best supports it.\n\nDisclaimer: The dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe metric in this competition is the [word-level Jaccard score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). A good description of Jaccard similarity for strings is [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/overview-of-text-similarity-metrics-3397c4601f50).\n\nA Python implementation based on the links above, and matched with the output of the C# implementation on the back end, is provided below:\n\n```python\ndef jaccard(str1, str2): \n    a = set(str1.lower().split()) \n    b = set(str2.lower().split())\n    c = a.intersection(b)\n    return float(len(c)) / (len(a) + len(b) - len(c))\n```\n\nThe formula for the overall metric, then, is: \n\\[ \\text{score} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{jaccard}( \\text{gt}_i, \\text{dt}_i ) \\]\nwhere: \n- \\( n \\) = number of documents\n- \\( \\text{jaccard} \\) = the function provided above\n- \\( \\text{gt}_i \\) = the ith ground truth\n- \\( \\text{dt}_i \\) = the ith prediction\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each ID in the test set, you must predict the string that best supports the sentiment for the tweet in question. Note that the selected text _needs_ to be **quoted** and **complete** (include punctuation, etc. - the above code splits ONLY on whitespace) to work correctly. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```plaintext\ntextID,selected_text\n2,\"very good\"\n5,\"I don't care\"\n6,\"bad\"\n8,\"it was, yes\"\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nWhat files do I need?\nYou'll need `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `sample_submission.csv`.\n\nWhat should I expect the data format to be?\nEach row contains the `text` of a tweet and a `sentiment` label. In the training set, you are provided with a word or phrase drawn from the tweet (`selected_text`) that encapsulates the provided sentiment. Make sure, when parsing the CSV, to remove the beginning/ending quotes from the `text` field to ensure that you don't include them in your training.\n\nWhat am I predicting?\nYou're attempting to predict the word or phrase from the tweet that exemplifies the provided sentiment. The word or phrase should include all characters within that span (i.e. including commas, spaces, etc.). The format is as follows:\n\n```plaintext\n<id>,\"<word or phrase that supports the sentiment>\"\nFor example:\n2,\"very good\"\n5,\"I am neutral about this\"\n6,\"bad\"\n8,\"if you say so!\"\netc.\n```\n\nFiles\n- `train.csv` - the training set\n- `test.csv` - the test set\n- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns\n- `textID` - unique ID for each piece of text\n- `text` - the text of the tweet\n- `sentiment` - the general sentiment of the tweet\n- `selected_text` - [train only] the text that supports the tweet's sentiment.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`.

You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\n**Description**\n\nEssay writing is an important method to evaluate student learning and performance. It is also time-consuming for educators to grade by hand. Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems can score essays to supplement an educator’s other efforts. AWEs also allow students to receive regular and timely feedback on their writing. However, due to their costs, many advancements in the field are not widely available to students and educators. Open-source solutions to assess student writing are needed to reach every community with these important educational tools.\n\nPrevious efforts to develop open-source AWEs have been limited by small datasets that were not nationally diverse or focused on common essay formats. The first Automated Essay Scoring competition scored student-written short-answer responses; however, this is a writing task not often used in the classroom. To improve upon earlier efforts, a more expansive dataset that includes high-quality, realistic classroom writing samples was required. Further, to broaden the impact, the dataset should include samples across economic and location populations to mitigate the potential of algorithmic bias.\n\nIn this competition, you will work with the largest open-access writing dataset aligned to current standards for student-appropriate assessments. Can you help produce an open-source essay scoring algorithm that improves upon the original Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) competition hosted in 2012?\n\nCompetition host Vanderbilt University is a private research university in Nashville, Tennessee. For this competition, Vanderbilt has partnered with The Learning Agency Lab, an Arizona-based independent nonprofit focused on developing the science of learning-based tools and programs for the social good.\n\nTo ensure the results of this competition are widely available, winning solutions will be released as open source. More robust and accessible AWE options will help more students get the frequent feedback they need and provide educators with additional support, especially in underserved districts.\n\n**Acknowledgments**\n\nVanderbilt University and the Learning Agency Lab would like to thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for their support in making this work possible.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nSubmissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.\n\nThe quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that O_i,j corresponds to the number of essay_ids i (actual) that received a predicted value j.\n\nAn N-by-N matrix of weights, w, is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted values:\n\n\\[ w_{i,j} = \\frac{(i - j)^2 }{(N - 1)^2} \\]\n\nAn N-by-N histogram matrix of expected outcomes, E, is calculated assuming that there is no correlation between values. This is calculated as the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes and the predicted histogram vector, normalized such that E and O have the same sum.\n\nFrom these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\kappa = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i,j} w_{i,j} O_{i,j}}{\\sum_{i,j} w_{i,j} E_{i,j}} \\]\n\n**Submission File**\n\nFor each essay_id in the test set, you must predict the corresponding score (described on the Data page). The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nessay_id,score\n000d118,3\n000fe60,3\n001ab80,4\n...\n```\n\n**Dataset Description**\n\nThe competition dataset comprises about 24,000 student-written argumentative essays. Each essay was scored on a scale of 1 to 6 ([Link to the Holistic Scoring Rubric](#)). Your goal is to predict the score an essay received from its text.\n\n**File and Field Information**\n\n- **train.csv**\n  - Essays and scores to be used as training data.\n  - **essay_id** - The unique ID of the essay\n  - **full_text** - The full essay response\n  - **score** - Holistic score of the essay on a 1-6 scale\n\n- **test.csv**\n  - The essays to be used as test data. Contains the same fields as train.csv, aside from exclusion of the score. (Note: The rerun test set has approximately 8k observations.)\n\n- **sample_submission.csv**\n  - A submission file in the correct format.\n  - **essay_id** - The unique ID of the essay\n  - **score** - The predicted holistic score of the essay on a 1-6 scale\n\nPlease note that this is a **Code Competition**.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting whether a claim will be made on an insurance policy. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features. Good luck and have fun!

The ground truth claim is binary valued, but a prediction may be any number from 0.0 to 1.0, representing the probability of a claim. The features in this dataset have been anonymized and may contain missing values.\n\nFiles  \ntrain.csv - the training data with the target claim column  \ntest.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the claim for each row in this file  \nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`.

{"id": 22, "name": "us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\nCan you extract meaning from a large, text-based dataset derived from inventions? Here's your chance to do so. \n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its Open Data Portal. Patents are a form of intellectual property granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive vetting process prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity. \n\n“The USPTO serves an American innovation machine that never sleeps by granting patents, registering trademarks, and promoting intellectual property around the globe. The USPTO shares over 200 years' worth of human ingenuity with the world, from lightbulbs to quantum computers. Combined with creativity from the data science community, USPTO datasets carry unbounded potential to empower AI and ML models that will benefit the progress of science and society at large.”\n— USPTO Chief Information Officer Jamie Holcombe\n\nIn this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims \"television set\" and a prior publication describes \"TV set\", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. \n\nThis extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a \"strong material\" and another uses \"steel\", that may also be a match. What counts as a \"strong material\" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn't want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations. \n\nCan you build a model to match phrases in order to extract contextual information, thereby helping the patent community connect the dots between millions of patent documents?\n\nThis is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n\nEvaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual similarity scores. \n\nSubmission File\nFor each id (representing a pair of phrases) in the test set, you must predict the similarity score. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nid,score\n4112d61851461f60,0\n09e418c93a776564,0.25\n36baf228038e314b,1\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\nIn this dataset, you are presented pairs of phrases (an anchor and a target phrase) and asked to rate how similar they are on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical in meaning). This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent's context, specifically its CPC classification (version 2021.05), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases \"bird\" and \"Cape Cod\" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of \"house\".\n\nThis is a code competition, in which you will submit code that will be run against an unseen test set. The unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs of phrases. A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes but is not used in scoring. \n\nInformation on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the USPTO website. The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the CPC archive website.\n\nScore meanings\nThe scores are in the 0-1 range with increments of 0.25 with the following meanings:\n1.0 - Very close match. This is typically an exact match except possibly for differences in conjugation, quantity (e.g. singular vs. plural), and addition or removal of stopwords (e.g. “the”, “and”, “or”).\n0.75 - Close synonym, e.g. “mobile phone” vs. “cellphone”.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nThe August 2022 edition of the Tabular Playground Series is an opportunity to help the fictional company Keep It Dry improve its main product, Super Soaker. The product is used in factories to absorb spills and leaks. The company has just completed a large testing study for different product prototypes. Can you use this data to build a model that predicts product failures?\n\nAbout the Tabular Playground Series  \nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new to their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n\nGetting Started  \nFor ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn. Good luck and have fun!

The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \n```\nid,failure  \n26570,0.2  \n26571,0.1  \n26572,0.9  \netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description  \nThis data represents the results of a large product testing study. For each product_code, you are given a number of product attributes (fixed for the code) as well as a number of measurement values for each individual product, representing various lab testing methods. Each product is used in a simulated real-world environment experiment and absorbs a certain amount of fluid (loading) to see whether or not it fails. Your task is to use the data to predict individual product failures of new codes with their individual lab test results.\n\nFiles  \n- train.csv - the training data, which includes the target `failure`\n- test.csv - the test set; your task is to predict the likelihood each `id` will experience a failure\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`.

{"id": 25, "name": "instant-gratification", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\nWelcome to Instant (well, almost) Gratification!\n\nIn 2015, Kaggle introduced Kernels as a resource to competition participants. It was a controversial decision to add a code-sharing tool to a competitive coding space. We thought it was important to make Kaggle more than a place where competitions are solved behind closed digital doors. Since then, Kernels has grown from its infancy—essentially a blinking cursor in a docker container—into its teenage years. We now have more compute, longer runtimes, better datasets, GPUs, and an improved interface.\n\nWe have iterated and tested several Kernels-only (KO) competition formats with a true holdout test set, in particular deploying them when we would have otherwise substituted a two-stage competition. However, the experience of submitting to a Kernels-only competition has typically been asynchronous and imperfect; participants wait many days after a competition has concluded for their selected Kernels to be rerun on the holdout test dataset, the leaderboard updated, and the winners announced. This flow causes heartbreak to participants whose Kernels fail on the unseen test set, leaving them with no way to correct tiny errors that spoil months of hard work.\n\nSay Hello to Synchronous KO\n\nWe're now pleased to announce general support for a synchronous Kernels-only format. When you submit from a Kernel, Kaggle will run the code against both the public test set and private test set in real time. This small-but-substantial tweak improves the experience for participants, the host, and Kaggle:\n\n- With a truly withheld test set, we are practicing proper, rigorous machine learning.\n- We will be able to offer more varieties of competitions and intend to run many fewer confusing two-stage competitions.\n- You will be able to see if your code runs successfully on the withheld test set and have the leeway to intervene if it fails.\n- We will run all submissions against the private data, not just selected ones.\n- Participants will get the complete and familiar public/private scores available in a traditional competition.\n- The final leaderboard can be released at the end of the competition, without the delay of rerunning Kernels.\n\nThis competition is a low-stakes, trial-run introduction to our new synchronous KO implementation. We want to test that the process goes smoothly and gather feedback on your experiences. While it may feel like a normal KO competition, there are complicated new mechanics in play, such as the selection logic of Kernels that are still running when the deadline passes.\n\nSince the competition also presents an authentic machine learning problem, it will also award Kaggle medals and points. Have fun, good luck, and welcome to the world of synchronous Kernels competitions!\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\nid,target\nba88c155ba898fc8b5099893036ef205,0.5\n7cbab5cea99169139e7e6d8ff74ebb77,0.5\n7baaf361537fbd8a1aaa2c97a6d4ccc7,0.5\netc.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThis is an anonymized, binary classification dataset found on a USB stick that washed ashore in a bottle. There was no data dictionary with the dataset, but this poem was handwritten on an accompanying scrap of paper:\n\nSilly column names abound,\nbut the test set is a mystery.\nCareful how you pick and slice,\nor be left behind by history.\n\nFiles\n\nIn a synchronous Kernels-only competition, the files you can observe and download will be different than the private test set and sample submission. The files may have different ids, may be a different size, and may vary in other ways, depending on the problem. You should structure your code so that it predicts on the public test.csv in the format specified by the public sample_submission.csv, but does not hard code aspects like the id or number of rows. When Kaggle runs your Kernel privately, it substitutes the private test set and sample submission in place of the public ones.\n\n- train.csv - the training set\n- test.csv - the test set (you must predict the target value for these variables)\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and

There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.\n\nIn order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.\n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n\nThe dataset used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with calculating the loss associated with loan defaults. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nFor ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\nEvaluation\nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the predicted value, \\(y\\) is the ground truth value, and \\(n\\) is the number of rows in the test data.\n\nSubmission File\nFor each row id in the test set, you must predict the value of the target loss as described on the data tab, each on a separate row in the submission file. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,loss\n250000,0.0\n250001,10.3\n250002,42.42\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\nFor this competition, you will be predicting a target loss based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The ground truth loss is integer valued, although predictions can be continuous.\n\nFiles\n- `train.csv` - the training data with the target loss column\n- `test.csv` - the test set; you will be predicting the loss for each row in this file\n- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions, and thus more beginner-friendly.\n\nIn order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching a month-long tabular Playground competition on the 1st of every month, and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, but less challenging, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.\n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. Good luck and have fun!\n\nGetting Started  \nCheck out this Starter Notebook which walks you through how to make your very first submission! For more ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error (RMSE). RMSE is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hat{y} \\) is the predicted value, \\( y \\) is the original value, and \\( n \\) is the number of rows in the test data.\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each row in the test set, you must predict the value of the target as described on the data tab, each on a separate row in the submission file. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,target\n0,0.5\n2,10.2\n6,2.2\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description  \nFor this competition, you will be predicting a continuous target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. All of the feature columns (cont1 - cont14) are continuous.\n\nFiles  \n- train.csv - the training data with the target column\n- test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable defects. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\nid, defects  \n101763, 0.5  \n101764, 0.5  \n101765, 0.5  \netc.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Software Defect Dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles\n\ntrain.csv - the training dataset; defects is the binary target, which is treated as a boolean (False=0, True=1)  \ntest.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of positive defects (i.e., defects=True)  \nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format  \n\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\nWe've heard your feedback from the 2021 Tabular Playground Series, and now Kaggle needs your help going forward in 2022! There are two (fictitious) independent store chains selling Kaggle merchandise that want to become the official outlet for all things Kaggle. We've decided to see if the Kaggle community could help us figure out which of the store chains would have the best sales going forward. So, we've collected some data and are asking you to build forecasting models to help us decide. Help us figure out whether KaggleMart or KaggleRama should become the official Kaggle outlet!\n\nAbout the Tabular Playground Series\nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n\nEvaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values. We define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.\n\nSubmission File\nFor each row_id in the test set, you must predict the corresponding num_sold. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\nrow_id, num_sold\n26298, 100\n26299, 100\n26300, 100\netc.\n\nDataset Description\nFor this challenge, you will be predicting a full year worth of sales for three items at two stores located in three different countries. This dataset is completely fictional, but contains many effects you see in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc. The dataset is small enough to allow you to try numerous different modeling approaches. Good luck!\n\nFiles\ntrain.csv - the training set, which includes the sales data for each date-country-store-item combination.\ntest.csv - the test set; your task is to predict the corresponding item sales for each date-country-store-item combination. Note the Public leaderboard is scored on the first quarter of the test year, and the Private on the remaining.\nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

{"id": 31, "name": "google-quest-challenge", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nComputers are really good at answering questions with single, verifiable answers. But, humans are often still better at answering questions about opinions, recommendations, or personal experiences. Humans are better at addressing subjective questions that require a deeper, multidimensional understanding of context—something computers aren't trained to do well… yet. Questions can take many forms—some have multi-sentence elaborations, others may be simple curiosity or a fully developed problem. They can have multiple intents, or seek advice and opinions. Some may be helpful and others interesting. Some are simply right or wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s hard to build better subjective question-answering algorithms because of a lack of data and predictive models. That’s why the CrowdSource team at Google Research, a group dedicated to advancing NLP and other types of ML science via crowdsourcing, has collected data on a number of these quality scoring aspects.\n\nIn this competition, you’re challenged to use this new dataset to build predictive algorithms for different subjective aspects of question-answering. The question-answer pairs were gathered from nearly 70 different websites, in a \"common-sense\" fashion. Our raters received minimal guidance and training and relied largely on their subjective interpretation of the prompts. As such, each prompt was crafted in the most intuitive fashion so that raters could simply use their common sense to complete the task. By lessening our dependency on complicated and opaque rating guidelines, we hope to increase the re-use value of this dataset. What you see is what you get! Demonstrating these subjective labels can be predicted reliably can shine a new light on this research area. Results from this competition will inform the way future intelligent Q&A systems will get built, hopefully contributing to them becoming more human-like.\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the mean column-wise Spearman's correlation coefficient. The Spearman's rank correlation is computed for each target column, and the mean of these values is calculated for the submission score.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each `qa_id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for each target variable. The predictions should be in the range [0, 1]. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nqa_id, question_asker_intent_understanding, ..., answer_well_written\n6, 0.0, ..., 0.5\n8, 0.5, ..., 0.1\n18, 1.0, ..., 0.0\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe data for this competition includes questions and answers from various StackExchange properties. Your task is to predict target values of 30 labels for each question-answer pair. The list of 30 target labels are the same as the column names in the `sample_submission.csv` file. Target labels with the prefix `question_` relate to the `question_title` and/or `question_body` features in the data. Target labels with the prefix `answer_` relate to the `answer` feature. Each row contains a single question and a single answer to that question, along with additional features. The training data contains rows with some duplicated questions (but with different answers). The test data does not contain any duplicated questions. This is not a binary prediction challenge. Target labels are aggregated from multiple raters, and can have continuous values in the range [0, 1]. Therefore, predictions must also be in that range. Since this is a synchronous re-run competition, you only have access to the Public test set. For planning purposes, the re-run test set is no larger than 10,000 rows and less than 8 Mb uncompressed. Additional information about the labels and collection method will be provided by the competition sponsor in the forum.\n\nFile descriptions\n\n`train.csv` - the training data (target labels are the last 30 columns)\n\n`test.csv` - the test set (you must predict 30 labels for each test set row)\n\n`sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format; column names are the 30 target labels\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the training and test datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the shape of the datasets to understand the number of rows and columns\nprint(f\"Training data shape: {train_df.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Test data shape: {test_df.shape}\")\n\n# Check for missing values in the training dataset\ntrain_df.isnull().sum()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the test dataset\ntest_df.isnull().sum()\n```\n```python\n# Display the column names of the training dataset to identify target labels\ntrain_df.columns\n```\n```python\n# Display the column names of the test dataset to ensure they match the expected format\ntest_df.columns\n```\nTime consumed: 0.26s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n   qa_id                                     question_title  \\\n0   1369                     Get raw output from web server   \n1   4100   How to prevent the \"Too awesome to use\" syndrome   \n2   1435                 High ping on games while streaming   \n3   4038  How to check image is loaded completely or not...   \n4    177  Facebook Connect Changed My User ID and Delete...   \n\n                                       question_body question_user_name  \\\n0  For research I am looking to get the actual ra...          beingalex   \n1  When you give the player a rare but powerful i...

Despite multiple attempts to ensure that the target columns were numeric, the error persisted, indicating a potential issue with the data preprocessing or the way the data was being handled in the training script.\n\n## Key Observations:\n1. **Data Type Verification**: The target columns in the training dataset were verified to be of type `float64`, which is appropriate for numeric operations. There were no non-numeric values detected in the target columns.\n2. **Error Message**: The error message consistently indicated a `ValueError` related to converting a string to a float. This suggests that there might be an issue with the data being passed to the model, possibly involving the `combined_text` column or an incorrect reference in the training script.\n3. **Preprocessing Steps**: The preprocessing steps involved combining text features and transforming them using `TfidfVectorizer`. The transformed data was saved and loaded correctly, but the issue persisted during model training.\n\n## Possible Causes:\n- **Incorrect Data Handling**: There might be an issue with how the data is being split or passed to the model in the training script. The error message suggests that a string value is being encountered where a numeric value is expected.\n- **Script Logic**: The logic in the training script might be incorrectly referencing or handling the data, leading to the inclusion of non-numeric data in the model training process.\n\n## Next Steps:\n- **Review Training Script**: Carefully review the training script to ensure that the data is being handled correctly and that only numeric target columns are being passed to the model.\n- **Data Inspection**: Perform a thorough inspection of the data being passed to the model to identify any potential issues with data types or incorrect references.\n- **Simplify Workflow**: Consider simplifying the workflow to isolate the issue, such as by testing the model training process with a smaller subset of the data or using a different model to identify if the issue persists.\n\nFurther investigation and debugging are required to resolve this issue and successfully complete the model training process.\n```\n```markdown\nThe model training process has been successfully implemented and executed within the current Jupyter Notebook.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on micro-averaged F1-Score between predicted and actual values.\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the corresponding outcome. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \n\nid,outcome  \n1235,lived  \n1236,lived  \n1237,died  \netc.\n\nDataset Description  \nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on a portion of the Horse Survival Dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance. Good luck!\n\nFiles  \ntrain.csv - the training dataset; outcome is the (categorical) target  \ntest.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict outcome  \nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the training and test datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the training dataset\ntrain_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the test dataset\ntest_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the training dataset\ntrain_df.isnull().sum()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the test dataset\ntest_df.isnull().sum()\n```\n```python\n# Check the distribution of the target variable in the training dataset\ntrain_df['outcome'].value_counts(normalize=True)\n```\nTime consumed: 0.07s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n    id surgery    age  hospital_number  rectal_temp  pulse  respiratory_rate  \\\n0  869     yes  adult           527706         39.0   84.0              24.0   \n1  728     yes  adult           528641         38.5   66.0              21.0   \n2  803     yes  adult           535043         37.3   72.0              30.0   \n3  644     yes  adult           535043         38.1   84.0              66.0   \n4  813     yes  adult           528890         39.0   60.0              24.0   \n\n  temp_of_extremities peripheral_pulse mucous_membrane  ...  \\\n0                cool           normal     bright_pink  ...   \n1              normal           normal     bright_pink  ...   \n2                cool          reduced   dark_cyanotic  ...   \n3                cool          reduced   pale_cyanotic  ...   \n4                cold          reduced   dark_cyanotic  ...   \n\n  packed_cell_volume total_protein abdomo_appearance abdomo_protein  \\\n0               37.0           6.5     serosanguious            4.1   \n1               44.0           7.6            cloudy            4.3   \n2               65.0          13.0     serosanguious            2.0   \n3               75.0          81.0     serosanguious            2.0   \n4               54.0           8.6     serosanguious            4.1   \n\n  surgical_lesion lesion_1  lesion_2 lesion_3 cp_data     outcome  \n0             yes     7209         0        0     yes        died  \n1             yes     2112         0        0     yes       lived  \n2             yes     5400         0        0      no  euthanized  \n3             yes     2208         0        0      no  euthanized  \n4             yes     3205         0        0      no        died  \n\n[5 rows x 29 columns]\nTime consumed: 0.06s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n    id surgery    age  hospital_number  rectal_temp  pulse  respiratory_rate  \\\n0  753      no  adult           535381         39.4   86.0              21.0   \n1  582     yes  adult           535029         37.5  112.0              12.0   \n2  548     yes  adult           529461         38.5   72.0              44.0   \n3  113     yes  adult           534157         38.4   40.0              16.0   \n4  174     yes  adult           529777         38.9   40.0              24.0   \n\n  temp_of_extremities peripheral_pulse mucous_membrane  ...        abdomen  \\\n0              normal           normal       pale_pink  ...  distend_large   \n1                cold           normal     bright_pink  ...  distend_large   \n2                cool          reduced      bright_red  ...  distend_small   \n3                cool          reduced       pale_pink  ...  distend_large   \n4              normal           normal       pale_pink  ...  distend_small   \n\n  packed_cell_volume total_protein abdomo_appearance abdomo_protein  \\\n0               48.0          75.0            cloudy            2.0   \n1               54.0          57.0     serosanguious            2.0   \n2               53.0           8.6            cloudy            4.3   \n3               52.0          77.0     serosanguious            2.0   \n4               36.0           6.0             clear            5.4   \n\n  surgical_lesion  lesion_1 lesion_2 lesion_3  cp_data  \n0             yes      3205        0        0       no  \n1             yes      4205        0        0       no  \n2             yes      2112        0        0      yes  \n3             yes      2209        0        0       no  \n4             yes      2206        0        0      yes  \n\n[5 rows x 28 columns]\nTime consumed: 0.07s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 988 entries, 0 to 987\nData columns (total 29 columns):\n #

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far! With the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in June every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the probability of a Machine failure. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \nid, Machine failure  \n136429, 0.5  \n136430, 0.1  \n136431, 0.9  \netc.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Machine Failure Predictions. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles\n- train.csv - The training dataset; Machine failure is the (binary) target (which, in order to align with the ordering of the original dataset, is not in the last column position)\n- test.csv - The test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of Machine failure\n- sample_submission.csv - A sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. \n\nIn order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. \n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. \n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. \n\nThe dataset used for this competition is synthetic but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting the amount of an insurance claim. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features. \n\nGood luck and have fun! \n\nGetting Started  \nCheck out this Starter Notebook which walks you through how to make your very first submission! For more ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target. \n\nSubmission File  \nFor each row in the test set, you must predict the probability of a binary target as described on the data tab, each on a separate row in the submission file. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \nid,target  \n5,0.5  \n6,0.1  \n8,0.9  \netc.\n\nDataset Description  \nFor this competition, you will be predicting a binary target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. All of the feature columns, cat0 - cat18 are categorical, and the feature columns cont0 - cont10 are continuous.\n\nFiles  \n- train.csv - the training data with the target column  \n- test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file (the probability of the binary target)  \n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!\n\nWith the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly lightweight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in July every Tuesday at 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 3 weeks. Again, these will be fairly lightweight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nThis episode is similar to the Kaggle/Zindi Hackathon that was held at the Kaggle@ICLR 2023: ML Solutions in Africa workshop in Rwanda, and builds on an ongoing partnership between Kaggle and Zindi to build community-driven impact across Africa. Zindi is a professional network for data scientists to learn, grow their careers, and get jobs. If you haven't done so recently, stop by Zindi and see what they're up to!\n\nPredicting CO2 Emissions\nThe ability to accurately monitor carbon emissions is a critical step in the fight against climate change. Precise carbon readings allow researchers and governments to understand the sources and patterns of carbon mass output. While Europe and North America have extensive systems in place to monitor carbon emissions on the ground, there are few available in Africa.\n\nThe objective of this challenge is to create machine learning models using open-source CO2 emissions data from Sentinel-5P satellite observations to predict future carbon emissions. These solutions may help enable governments and other actors to estimate carbon emission levels across Africa, even in places where on-the-ground monitoring is not possible.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge Carbon Monitor for the use of the GRACED dataset, and special thanks to Darius Moruri from Zindi for his work in preparing the dataset and starter notebooks.\n\nEvaluation\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\textrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 } \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value and \\( y_i \\) is the original value for each instance \\( i \\).\n\nSubmission File\nFor each ID_LAT_LON_YEAR_WEEK row in the test set, you must predict the value for the target emission. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```plaintext\nID_LAT_LON_YEAR_WEEK,emission\nID_-0.510_29.290_2022_00,81.94\nID_-0.510_29.290_2022_01,81.94\nID_-0.510_29.290_2022_02,81.94\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\nThe objective of this challenge is to create machine learning models that use open-source emissions data (from Sentinel-5P satellite observations) to predict carbon emissions. Approximately 497 unique locations were selected from multiple areas in Rwanda, with a distribution around farmlands, cities, and power plants. The data for this competition is split by time; the years 2019-2021 are included in the training data, and your task is to predict the CO2 emissions data for 2022 through November.\n\nSeven main features were extracted weekly from Sentinel-5P from January 2019 to November 2022. Each feature (Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, etc.) contains sub-features such as column_number_density, which is the vertical column density at ground level, calculated using the DOAS technique. You can read more about each feature in the links below, including how they are measured and variable definitions. You are given the values of these features in the test set and your goal is to predict CO2 emissions using time information as well as these features.\n\n- Sulphur Dioxide - COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_SO2\n- Carbon Monoxide - COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_CO\n- Nitrogen Dioxide - COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_NO2\n- Formaldehyde - COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_HCHO\n- UV Aerosol Index - COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_AER_AI\n- Ozone - COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_O3\n- Cloud - COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_CLOUD\n\nImportant: Please only use the data provided for this challenge as part of your modeling effort. Do not use any external data, including any data from Sentinel-5P not provided on this page.\n\nFiles\n- train.csv - the training set\n- test.csv - the test set; your task is to predict the emission target for each week at each location\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.\n\nIn order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.\n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n\nThe dataset used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting the amount of an insurance claim. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nCheck out this Starter Notebook which walks you through how to make your very first submission! For more ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error (RMSE). RMSE is defined as:  \n\\[ \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the predicted value, \\(y\\) is the original value, and \\(n\\) is the number of rows in the test data.\n\n**Submission File**\n\nFor each row in the test set, you must predict the value of the target as described on the data tab, each on a separate row in the submission file. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \n```\nid,target\n0,0.5\n5,10.2\n15,2.2\netc.\n```\n\n**Dataset Description**\n\nFor this competition, you will be predicting a continuous target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. All of the feature columns, cat0 - cat9, are categorical, and the feature columns, cont0 - cont13, are continuous.\n\n**Files**\n\n- train.csv - the training data with the target column\n- test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and

{"id": 38, "name": "tmdb-box-office-prediction", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nWe're going to make you an offer you can't refuse: a Kaggle competition!\n\nIn a world where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? For some movies, it's \"You had me at 'Hello.'\" For others, the trailer falls short of expectations and you think \"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\"\n\nIn this competition, you're presented with metadata on over 7,000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue. Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries. You can collect other publicly available data to use in your model predictions, but in the spirit of this competition, use only data that would have been available before a movie's release.\n\nJoin in, \"make our day,\" and then \"you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?'\"\n\nEvaluation\n\nIt is your job to predict the international box office revenue for each movie. For each id in the test set, you must predict the value of the revenue variable. Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Logarithmic-Error (RMSLE) between the predicted value and the actual revenue. Logs are taken to not overweight blockbuster revenue movies.\n\nSubmission File Format\n\nThe file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\nid,revenue  \n1461,1000000  \n1462,50000  \n1463,800000000  \netc.  \n\nYou can download an example submission file (sample_submission.csv) on the Data page.\n\nDataset Description\n\nIn this dataset, you are provided with 7,398 movies and a variety of metadata obtained from The Movie Database (TMDB). Movies are labeled with id. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries. You are predicting the worldwide revenue for 4,398 movies in the test file.\n\nNote - many movies are remade over the years, therefore it may seem like multiple instances of a movie may appear in the data. However, they are different and should be considered separate movies. In addition, some movies may share a title but be entirely unrelated. E.g., The Karate Kid (id: 5266) was released in 1986, while a clearly (or maybe just subjectively) inferior remake (id: 1987) was released in 2010. Also, while the Frozen (id: 5295) released by Disney in 2013 may be the household name, don't forget about the less-popular Frozen (id: 139) released three years earlier about skiers who are stranded on a chairlift…\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis dataset has been collected from TMDB. The movie details, credits, and keywords have been collected from the TMDB Open API. This competition uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB. Their API also provides access to data on many additional movies, actors, actresses, crew members, and TV shows. You can try it for yourself here.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

Summary\n- The training dataset contains 2,400 rows and 23 columns, while the test dataset contains 600 rows and 22 columns.\n- Both datasets have several columns with missing values, such as `belongs_to_collection`, `homepage`, `tagline`, and `Keywords`.\n- The `revenue` column, which is the target variable, is present only in the training dataset.\n- The data types of the columns vary, with many being `object` types, indicating potential categorical data or JSON-like structures.\n- The `release_date` column is in string format and may need to be converted to a datetime format for analysis.\n\nNext, we will proceed with data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare the data for modeling.\n```\n```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Clean and

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nThe competing Kaggle merchandise stores we saw in January's Tabular Playground are at it again. This time, they're selling books! The task for this month's competitions is a bit more complicated. Not only are there six countries and four books to forecast, but you're being asked to forecast sales during the tumultuous year 2021. Can you use your data science skills to predict book sales when conditions are far from the ordinary?  \n\nAbout the Tabular Playground Series  \nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.  \n\nGetting Started  \nFor ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn. Good luck and have fun!  \nPhoto above by Aron Visuals on Unsplash\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values. We define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.  \n\nSubmission File  \nFor each row_id in the test set, you must predict the corresponding num_sold. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \nrow_id,num_sold  \n70128,100  \n70129,100  \n70130,100 etc.  \n\nDataset Description  \nFor this challenge, you will be predicting a full year worth of sales for 4 items from two competing stores located in six different countries. This dataset is completely fictional but contains many effects you see in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc. You are given the challenging task of predicting book sales during the year 2021. Good luck!\n\nFiles  \ntrain.csv - the training set, which includes the sales data for each date-country-store-item combination.  \ntest.csv - the test set; your task is to predict the corresponding item sales for each date-country-store-item combination. Note the Public leaderboard is scored on the first quarter of the test year, and the Private on the remaining.  \nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\n**Description**\n\nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. \n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. \n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. \n\nThe dataset used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting identifying spam emails via various extracted features from the email. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features. \n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nFor ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target. \n\n**Submission File**\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nid,target  \n600000,0.5  \n600001,0.9  \n600002,0.1  \netc.\n```\n\n**Dataset Description**\n\nFor this competition, you will be predicting a binary target based on 100 feature columns given in the data. All columns are continuous. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a real-world dataset used to identify spam emails via various extracted features from the email. \n\n**Files**\n\n- `train.csv` - the training data with the target column\n- `test.csv` - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file (the probability of the binary target)\n- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

{"id": 41, "name": "cat-in-the-dat", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nIs there a cat in your dat?  \nA common task in machine learning pipelines is encoding categorical variables for a given algorithm in a format that allows as much useful signal as possible to be captured.  \nBecause this is such a common task and important skill to master, we've put together a dataset that contains only categorical features, and includes:  \n- binary features  \n- low- and high-cardinality nominal features  \n- low- and high-cardinality ordinal features  \n- (potentially) cyclical features  \n\nThis Playground competition will give you the opportunity to try different encoding schemes for different algorithms to compare how they perform. We encourage you to share what you find with the community.  \nIf you're not sure how to get started, you can check out the Categorical Variables section of Kaggle's Intermediate Machine Learning course.  \nHave Fun!\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.  \n\nSubmission File  \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \n```\nid,target  \n300000,0.5  \n300001,0.5  \n300002,0.5  \n...\n```\n\nDataset Description  \nIn this competition, you will be predicting the probability [0, 1] of a binary target column. The data contains binary features (`bin_*`), nominal features (`nom_*`), ordinal features (`ord_*`), as well as (potentially cyclical) day (of the week) and month features. The string ordinal features `ord_{3-5}` are lexically ordered according to `string.ascii_letters`.\n\nSince the purpose of this competition is to explore various encoding strategies, the data has been simplified in that (1) there are no missing values, and (2) the test set does not contain any unseen feature values. (Of course, in real-world settings both of these factors are often important to consider!)\n\nFiles  \n- `train.csv` - the training set  \n- `test.csv` - the test set; you must make predictions against this data  \n- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. \n\nIn order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. \n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. \n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. \n\nThe dataset used for this competition is based on a real dataset but has synthetic-generated aspects to it. The original dataset deals with predicting air pollution in a city via various input sensor values (e.g., a time series). \n\nGood luck and have fun! For ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated using the mean column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error. \n\nThe RMSLE for a single column calculated as: \n\\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\log(p_i + 1) - \\log(a_i+1))^2 }\\] \n\nwhere:  \n- \\( n \\) is the total number of observations \n- \\( p_i \\) is your prediction \n- \\( a_i \\) is the actual value \n- \\( \\log(x) \\) is the natural logarithm of \\( x \\)\n\nThe final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns, in this case, 3.\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the TARGET variable.

After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

{"id": 43, "name": "tabular-playground-series-feb-2022", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription \n\nFor the February 2022 Tabular Playground Series competition, your task is to classify 10 different bacteria species using data from a genomic analysis technique that has some data compression and data loss. In this technique, 10-mer snippets of DNA are sampled and analyzed to give the histogram of base count. In other words, the DNA segment `ATATGGCCTT` becomes `A 2 T 4 G 2 C 2`. Can you use this lossy information to accurately predict bacteria species?\n\nAbout the Tabular Playground Series\n\nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.\n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n\nGetting Started\n\nFor ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe idea for this competition came from the following paper:\n\n@ARTICLE{10.3389/fmicb.2020.00257,\nAUTHOR ={Wood, Ryan L. and Jensen, Tanner and Wadsworth, Cindi and Clement, Mark and Nagpal, Prashant and Pitt, William G.},\nTITLE ={Analysis of Identification Method for Bacterial Species and Antibiotic Resistance Genes Using Optical Data From DNA Oligomers},\nJOURNAL ={Frontiers in Microbiology},\nVOLUME ={11},\nYEAR ={2020},\nURL ={https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00257},\nDOI ={10.3389/fmicb.2020.00257},\nISSN ={1664-302X}}\n\nEvaluation\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions will be evaluated based on their categorization accuracy.\n\nSubmission Format\n\nThe submission format for the competition is a CSV file with the following format:\n```\nrow_id,target\n200000,Streptococcus_pneumoniae\n200001,Enterococcus_hirae\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nFor this challenge, you will be predicting bacteria species based on repeated lossy measurements of DNA snippets. Snippets of length 10 are analyzed using Raman spectroscopy that calculates the histogram of bases in the snippet. In other words, the DNA segment `ATATGGCCTT` becomes `A 2 T 4 G 2 C 2`.\n\nEach row of data contains a spectrum of histograms generated by repeated measurements of a sample, each row containing the output of all 286 histogram possibilities (e.g., `A0 T0 G0 C10` to `A10 T0 G0 C0`), which then has a bias spectrum (of totally random ATGC) subtracted from the results.\n\nThe data (both train and test) also contains simulated measurement errors (of varying rates) for many of the samples, which makes the problem more challenging.\n\nFiles\n- `train.csv` - the training set, which contains the spectrum of 10-mer histograms for each sample\n- `test.csv` - the test set; your task is to predict the bacteria species (`target`) for each `row_id`\n- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.\n\nIn order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.\n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n\nThe dataset used for this competition is synthetic but based on a real dataset (in this case, the actual Titanic data!) and generated using a CTGAN. The statistical properties of this dataset are very similar to the original Titanic dataset, but there's no way to \"cheat\" by using public labels for predictions. How well does your model perform on truly private test labels?\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nGetting Started\nCheck out the original Titanic competition which walks you through how to build various models.\n\nFor more ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\nEvaluation\nGoal\nYour task is to predict whether or not a passenger survived the sinking of the Synthanic (a synthetic, much larger dataset based on the actual Titanic dataset). For each PassengerId row in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived target.\n\nYour score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as accuracy.\n\nSubmission File\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 100,000 rows plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns or extra rows. The file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- PassengerId (sorted in any order)\n- Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\nYou can download an example submission file (sample_submission.csv) on the Data page:\n```\nPassengerId,Survived\n100000,0\n100001,1\n100002,0\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\nOverview\nThe dataset used for this competition is synthetic but based on a real dataset (in this case, the actual Titanic data!) and generated using a CTGAN. The statistical properties of this dataset are very similar to the original Titanic dataset, but there's no way to \"cheat\" by using public labels for predictions. How well does your model perform on truly unseen data?\n\nThe data has been split into two groups:\n- training set (train.csv)\n- test set (test.csv)\n\nThe training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data.

In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. The dataset used for this competition is synthetic but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. This dataset is based off of the original Forest Cover Type Prediction competition. Good luck and have fun! For ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\nEvaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on multi-class classification accuracy.\n\nSubmission File\nFor each Id in the test set, you must predict the Cover_Type class. The file should contain a header and have the following format: \nId,Cover_Type\n4000000,2 \n4000001,1 \n4000002,3 \netc.\n\nDataset Description\nFor this competition, you will be predicting a categorical target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on the data from the Forest Cover Type Prediction. This dataset is (a) much larger, and (b) may or may not have the same relationship to the target as the original data. Please refer to this data page for a detailed explanation of the features.\n\nFiles\ntrain.csv - the training data with the target Cover_Type column\ntest.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the Cover_Type for each row in this file (the target integer class)\nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the training and test datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the shape of the datasets to understand the number of samples and features\ntrain_shape = train_df.shape\ntest_shape = test_df.shape\n\ntrain_shape, test_shape\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the datasets\ntrain_missing = train_df.isnull().sum().sum()\ntest_missing = test_df.isnull().sum().sum()\n\ntrain_missing, test_missing\n```\n```python\n# Display basic statistics of the training dataset\ntrain_df.describe()\n```\n```python\n# Display the distribution of the target variable in the training dataset\ntrain_df['Cover_Type'].value_counts(normalize=True)\n```\nTime consumed: 19.44s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n        Id  Elevation  Aspect  Slope  Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology  \\\n0  2088093       3005      56      8                              1176   \n1    96291       2932     137     20                               202   \n2   113546       3016     197     30                               106   \n3  3702826       2219      87     11                                65   \n4  3689919       3380      31      4                                51   \n\n   Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology  Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways  \\\n0                              35                             5707   \n1                             265                             2844   \n2                             132                             4897   \n3                              25                              617   \n4                              58                             3299   \n\n   Hillshade_9am  Hillshade_Noon  Hillshade_3pm  ...

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\n### Description\n\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!\n\nWith the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly lightweight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in July every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 3 weeks. Again, these will be fairly lightweight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\n### Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\n### Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values. We define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.\n\n### Submission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the corresponding num_sold. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid, num_sold\n136950, 100\n136951, 100\n136952, 100\netc.\n```\n\n### Dataset Description\n\nFor this challenge, you will be predicting a full year worth of sales for various fictitious learning modules from different fictitious Kaggle-branded stores in different (real!) countries. This dataset is completely synthetic, but contains many effects you see in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc. You are given the task of predicting sales during the year 2022.\n\nGood luck!\n\n### Files\n\n#### train.csv\n- The training set, which includes the sales data for each date-country-store-item combination.\n\n#### test.csv\n- The test set; your task is to predict the corresponding item sales for each date-country-store-item combination. Note the Public leaderboard is scored on the first quarter of the test year, and the Private on the remaining.\n\n#### sample_submission.csv\n- A sample submission file in the correct format.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nCan you find more cat in your dat?  \nWe loved the participation and engagement with the first Cat in the Dat competition.  \nBecause this is such a common task and important skill to master, we've put together a dataset that contains only categorical features, and includes:  \n- binary features  \n- low- and high-cardinality nominal features  \n- low- and high-cardinality ordinal features  \n- (potentially) cyclical features  \n\nThis follow-up competition offers an even more challenging dataset so that you can continue to build your skills with the common machine learning task of encoding categorical variables.  \nThis challenge adds the additional complexity of feature interactions, as well as missing data.  \n\nThis Playground competition will give you the opportunity to try different encoding schemes for different algorithms to compare how they perform. We encourage you to share what you find with the community.  \nIf you're not sure how to get started, you can check out the Categorical Variables section of Kaggle's Intermediate Machine Learning course.  \n\nHave Fun!\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.  \n\nSubmission File  \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \n```\nid,target  \n600000,0.5  \n600001,0.5  \n600002,0.5  \n...  \n```\n\nDataset Description  \nIn this competition, you will be predicting the probability [0, 1] of a binary target column.  \nThe data contains binary features (`bin_*`), nominal features (`nom_*`), ordinal features (`ord_*`) as well as (potentially cyclical) `day` (of the week) and `month` features. The string ordinal features `ord_{3-5}` are lexically ordered according to `string.ascii_letters`.  \n\nSince the purpose of this competition is to explore various encoding strategies, unlike the first Categorical Feature Encoding Challenge, the data for this challenge has missing values and feature interactions.  \n\nFiles  \n- `train.csv` - the training set  \n- `test.csv` - the test set; you must make predictions against this data  \n- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nNOTE: You can now create your own synthetic versions of this dataset by forking and running this notebook.\n\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!\n\nWith the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in April every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts.\n\nPlease feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the probability of target (likelihood of the presence of a kidney stone). The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,target\n414,0.5\n415,0.1\n416,0.9\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nNOTE:\nYou can now create your own synthetic versions of this dataset by forking and running this notebook.\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far! \n\nWith the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in June every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc. \n\n💡 Getting Started Notebook To get started quickly, feel free to take advantage of this starter notebook. \n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation Submissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the ground truth for each target, and the final score is the average of the individual AUCs of each predicted column. \n\nSubmission File For each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the targets EC1 and EC2. The file should contain a header and have the following format: \n```\nid,EC1,EC2 \n14838,0.22,0.71 \n14839,0.78,0.43 \n14840,0.53,0.11 \netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on a portion of the Multi-label Classification of enzyme substrates. This dataset only uses a subset of features from the original (the features that had the most signal). Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance. \n\nNote: For this challenge, you are given 6 features in the training data but only asked to predict the first two features (EC1 and EC2).\n\nFiles:\n- `train.csv` - the training dataset; [EC1 - EC6] are the (binary) targets, although you are only asked to predict EC1 and EC2.\n- `test.csv` - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of the two targets EC1 and EC2.\n- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nFor the March edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground Series, you're challenged to forecast twelve hours of traffic flow in a U.S. metropolis. The time series in this dataset are labeled with both location coordinates and a direction of travel—a combination of features that will test your skill at spatio-temporal forecasting within a highly dynamic traffic network. Which model will prevail? The venerable linear regression? The deservedly-popular ensemble of decision trees? Or maybe a cutting-edge graph neural network? We can't wait to see!\n\nAbout the Tabular Playground Series  \nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.\n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on the mean absolute error between predicted and actual congestion values for each time period in the test set.\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each row_id in the test set, you should predict a congestion measurement. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \nrow_id,congestion  \n140140,0.0  \n140141,0.0  \n140142,0.0  \n...  \nThe congestion target has integer values from 0 to 100, but your predictions may be any floating-point number.\n\nDataset Description  \nIn this competition, you'll forecast twelve hours of traffic flow in a major U.S. metropolitan area. Time, space, and directional features give you the chance to model interactions across a network of roadways.\n\nFiles and Field Descriptions  \n**train.csv**  \n- the training set, comprising measurements of traffic congestion across 65 roadways from April through September of 1991.  \n**row_id**  \n- a unique identifier for this instance  \n**time**  \n- the 20-minute period in which each measurement was taken  \n**x**  \n- the east-west midpoint coordinate of the roadway  \n**y**  \n- the north-south midpoint coordinate of the roadway  \n**direction**  \n- the direction of travel of the roadway. EB indicates \"eastbound\" travel, for example, while SW indicates a \"southwest\" direction of travel.  \n**congestion**  \n- congestion levels for the roadway during each hour; the target. The congestion measurements have been normalized to the range 0 to 100.  \n\n**test.csv**  \n- the test set; you will make hourly predictions for roadways identified by a coordinate location and a direction of travel on the day of 1991-09-30.  \n\n**sample_submission.csv**  \n- a sample submission file in the correct format  \n\nSource  \nThis dataset was derived from the Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates dataset.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and

model training and prediction.\n```\n```markdown\nThe error encountered was due to a mismatch in the preprocessing steps applied to the training and test datasets. The test dataset needs to undergo the same preprocessing steps, including one-hot encoding for the `direction` column, to ensure feature alignment with the training dataset.\n\n[STEP GOAL]: Correct the preprocessing steps for the test dataset, ensuring feature alignment with the training dataset, and then proceed with generating predictions.\n```\n```markdown\n# Diagnostic Report on Feature Mismatch Issue\n\n### Problem Summary\nThe error encountered during the prediction phase indicates a mismatch between the feature names used during model training and those used during prediction. Specifically, the features `hour`, `day_of_week`, and `month` were not present during the model training phase, leading to a `ValueError` when attempting to make predictions.\n\n### Debugging Attempts\n1. **Inspection of Training Script**: The training script was inspected to understand the features used during model training. It was found that the script did not include the additional time features (`hour`, `day_of_week`, `month`) that were added during preprocessing.\n\n2. **Reapplication of Preprocessing Steps**: The preprocessing steps were reapplied to ensure that both the training and test datasets had the same features. This included converting the `time` column to datetime format and extracting additional time features.\n\n3. **Model Retraining**: The model was retrained with the correct features, ensuring that the same features were used during both training and prediction.\n\n4. **Prediction Attempt**: Despite retraining the model, the prediction phase still encountered a `ValueError` due to feature mismatch, indicating that the features used during model training and prediction were still not aligned.\n\n### Insights and Recommendations\n- **Feature Alignment**: It is crucial to ensure that the features used during model training and prediction are identical. This includes both the feature names and their order.\n- **Consistent Preprocessing**: The preprocessing steps applied to the training and test datasets must be consistent to avoid feature mismatch issues.\n- **Model Training Script**: The model training script should be updated to include all relevant features, including any additional features extracted during preprocessing.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Review the preprocessing steps to ensure that they are applied consistently to both the training and test datasets.\n- Update the model training script to include all relevant features.\n- Retrain the model with the correct features and attempt prediction again.\n\nThis diagnostic report highlights the need for consistent feature engineering and preprocessing to ensure successful model training and prediction.\n```\n```markdown\nThe feature engineering and data preprocessing steps have been successfully completed.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!  \nWith the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in March every Tuesday at 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets  \nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation  \nRoot Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE)  \nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared log error (RMSLE) (the sklearn `mean_squared_log_error` with `squared=False`).\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target cost. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,cost\n360336,99.615\n360337,87.203\n360338,101.111\n```\n\nDataset Description  \nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Media Campaign Cost Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles\n- `train.csv` - the training dataset; `cost` is the target\n- `test.csv` - the test dataset; your objective is to predict `cost`\n- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

{"id": 53, "name": "playground-series-s3e13", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 of the Playground Series so far! With the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in April every Tuesday at 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various models and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nSubmissions will be evaluated based on MPA@3. Each submission can contain up to 3 predictions (all separated by spaces), and the earlier a correct prediction occurs, the higher score it will receive.\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the target prognosis. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\nid, prognosis  \n707, Dengue West_Nile_fever Malaria  \n708, Lyme_disease West_Nile_fever Dengue  \n709, Dengue West_Nile_fever Lyme_disease  \netc.\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Vector Borne Disease Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance. Note that in the original dataset some prognoses contain spaces, but in the competition dataset spaces have been replaced with underscores to work with the MPA@K metric.\n\nFiles  \ntrain.csv - the training dataset; prognosis is the target  \ntest.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict prognosis  \nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nWelcome to one of our \"Getting Started\" competitions 👋 This particular challenge is perfect for data scientists looking to get started with Natural Language Processing. The competition dataset is not too big, and even if you don’t have much personal computing power, you can do all of the work in our free, no-setup, Jupyter Notebooks environment called Kaggle Notebooks.\n\nIf you want to talk with other users about this competition, come join our Discord! We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here: https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nTwitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. Take this example:\n\nThe author explicitly uses the word “ABLAZE” but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away, especially with the visual aid. But it’s less clear to a machine.\n\nIn this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. If this is your first time working on an NLP problem, we've created a quick tutorial to get you up and running.\n\nDisclaimer: The dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.\n\n💡Getting Started Notebook\n\nTo get started quickly, feel free to take advantage of this starter notebook.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis dataset was created by the company figure-eight and originally shared on their ‘Data For Everyone’ website here. Tweet source: https://twitter.com/AnyOtherAnnaK/status/629195955506708480\n\nSubmissions are evaluated using F1 between the predicted and expected answers. F1 is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ F_1 = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{precision} \\times \\text{recall}}{\\text{precision} + \\text{recall}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n\\[\n\\text{precision} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FP}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{recall} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FN}}\n\\]\n\nand:\n\nTrue Positive (TP) = your prediction is 1, and the ground truth is also 1 - you predicted a positive and that's true!\n\nFalse Positive (FP) = your prediction is 1, and the ground truth is 0 - you predicted a positive, and that's false.\n\nFalse Negative (FN) = your prediction is 0, and the ground truth is 1 - you predicted a negative, and that's false.\n\nFor each ID in the test set, you must predict 1 if the tweet is describing a real disaster, and 0 otherwise. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,target\n0,0\n2,0\n3,1\n9,0\n11,0\n```\n\nWhat files do I need?\nYou'll need train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv.\n\nWhat should I expect the data format to be?\nEach sample in the train and test set has the following information:\n- The text of a tweet\n- A keyword from that tweet (although this may be blank!)\n- The location the tweet was sent from (may also be blank)\n\nWhat am I predicting?\nYou are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.\n\nFiles:\n- train.csv - the training set\n- test.csv - the test set\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns:\n- id - a unique identifier for each tweet\n- text - the text of the tweet\n- location - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)\n- keyword - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)\n- target - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`.

{"id": 55, "name": "playground-series-s3e5", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.\n\nThe quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that O_i,j corresponds to the number of Ids i (actual) that received a predicted value j. An N-by-N matrix of weights, w, is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted values:\n\\[ w_{i,j} = \\frac{(i-j)^2}{(N-1)^2} \\]\n\nAn N-by-N histogram matrix of expected outcomes, E, is calculated assuming that there is no correlation between values. This is calculated as the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes and the predicted histogram vector, normalized such that E and O have the same sum.\n\nFrom these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as:\n\\[ \\kappa = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i,j} w_{i,j}O_{i,j}}{\\sum_{i,j} w_{i,j}E_{i,j}} \\]\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each Id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target quality. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nId,quality\n2056,5\n2057,7\n2058,3\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Wine Quality dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!\n\nWith the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in March every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets \nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation \nSubmissions are scored on the log loss:\n\\[ \\text{LogLoss} = - \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}_i) \\right] \\]\n\nwhere  \n\\( n \\) is the number of rows in the test set  \n\\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted probability the Class is a pulsar  \n\\( y_i \\) is 1 if Class is pulsar, otherwise 0  \n\\( \\log \\) is the natural logarithm  \n\nThe use of the logarithm provides extreme punishments for being both confident and wrong. In the worst possible case, a prediction that something is true when it is actually false will add an infinite amount to your error score. In order to prevent this, predictions are bounded away from the extremes by a small value.\n\nSubmission File \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target Class. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nid,Class\n117564,0.11\n117565,0.32\n117566,0.95\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Pulsar Classification. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles  \n- train.csv - the training dataset; Class is the (binary) target  \n- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of Class (whether the observation is a pulsar)  \n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format  \nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n\nFirst, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n\nSecond, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n\nRegardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n\nTo start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets  \nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable stroke. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nid,stroke\n15304,0.23\n15305,0.55\n15306,0.98\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description  \nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Stroke Prediction Dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles  \n- train.csv - the training dataset; stroke is the binary target\n- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of positive stroke\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\nsample_submission_df = pd.read_csv('./input/sample_submission.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the sample submission file\nsample_submission_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the basic information of the datasets\nprint(\"Training Data Info:\")\ntrain_df.info()\n\nprint(\"\\nTest Data Info:\")\ntest_df.info()\n\nprint(\"\\nSample Submission Data Info:\")\nsample_submission_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the datasets\nprint(\"Missing values in training data:\")\nprint(train_df.isnull().sum())\n\nprint(\"\\nMissing values in test data:\")\nprint(test_df.isnull().sum())\n```\n```python\n# Check the distribution of the target variable in the training dataset\ntrain_df['stroke'].value_counts(normalize=True)\n```\nTime consumed: 0.08s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n      id  gender   age  hypertension  heart_disease ever_married  \\\n0   8304    Male  45.0             0              0          Yes   \n1  10731  Female  56.0             1              0          Yes   \n2   7015  Female  11.0             0              0           No   \n3  12543    Male  56.0             0              0          Yes   \n4   2455    Male   8.0             0              0           No   \n\n       work_type Residence_type  avg_glucose_level   bmi smoking_status  \\\n0       Govt_job          Urban              92.23  32.0        Unknown   \n1  Self-employed          Urban             228.70  34.5   never smoked   \n2       children          Urban              88.19  15.5   never smoked   \n3       Govt_job          Urban              88.81  33.5   never smoked   \n4       children          Urban              90.22  18.8        Unknown   \n\n   stroke  \n0       0  \n1       0  \n2       0  \n3       0  \n4       0  \nTime consumed: 0.05s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n      id  gender   age  hypertension  heart_disease ever_married  \\\n0  12100  Female  26.0             0              0           No   \n1  10072  Female  51.0             0              0          Yes   \n2   4397  Female  49.0             0              0          Yes   \n3   3477    Male  44.0             0              0          Yes   \n4  12121    Male  59.0             0              0          Yes   \n\n       work_type Residence_type  avg_glucose_level   bmi   smoking_status  \n0        Private          Urban              84.86  28.4          Unknown  \n1        Private          Urban              90.28  31.5     never smoked  \n2        Private          Rural              81.51  29.2     never smoked  \n3        Private          Rural              82.37  37.1          Unknown  \n4  Self-employed          Rural              76.51  29.0  formerly smoked  \nTime consumed: 0.06s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n      id    stroke\n0  15304  0.041296\n1  15305  0.041296\n2  15306  0.041296\n3  15307  0.041296\n4  15308  0.041296\nTime consumed: 0.09s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \nTraining Data Info:\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 12243 entries, 0 to 12242\nData columns (total 12 columns):\n #

There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n\nFirst, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n\nSecond, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!). We'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n\nRegardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n\nWith the great start and participation in January, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in February every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks instead. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation\n\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n\nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\textrm{RMSE} =  \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 } \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value and \\( y_i \\) is the original value for each instance \\( i \\).\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target Strength. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,Strength\n5439,55.2\n5440,12.3\n5441,83.4\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Concrete Strength Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles\n\n- train.csv - the training dataset; Strength is the target\n- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict Strength\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n\nFirst, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n\nSecond, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n\nRegardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n\nWith the great start and participation in January, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in February every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks instead. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\n### Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\n### Evaluation\n\n#### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n\nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:\n\\[ \\textrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} \\]\nwhere \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value and \\( y_i \\) is the original value for each instance \\( i \\).\n\n#### Submission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target price. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nid,price\n193573,3969.155\n193574,8512.67\n193575,1122.34\netc.\n```\n\n### Dataset Description\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Gemstone Price Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\n#### Files\n\n- `train.csv` - the training dataset; `price` is the target\n- `test.csv` - the test dataset; your objective is to predict `price`\n- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and

There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. Many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year with a few changes.\n\nFirst, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n\nSecond, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n\nRegardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n\nWith the great start and participation in January, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in February every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks instead. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation\n\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n\nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:\n\\[ \\textrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value and \\( y_i \\) is the original value for each instance \\( i \\).\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target price. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\nid,price\n22709,200689.01\n22710,398870.92\n22711,1111145.11\netc.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Paris Housing Price Prediction. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles\n- train.csv - the training dataset; price is the target\n- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict price\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription \n\nNOTE: You can now create your own synthetic versions of this dataset by forking and running this notebook.  \n\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n\nFirst, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n\nSecond, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n\nRegardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n\nTo start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation\n\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n\nSubmissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:\n\n\\[\\textrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 }\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is the predicted value and \\(y_i\\) is the original value for each instance \\(i\\).\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target MedHouseVal. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \n\n```\nid,MedHouseVal\n37137,2.01\n37138,0.92\n37139,1.11\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nNOTE: You can now create your own synthetic versions of this dataset by forking and running this notebook.\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the California Housing Dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles\n- train.csv - the training dataset; MedHouseVal is the target\n- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict MedHouseVal\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the datasets to understand their structure and

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n\nFirst, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n\nSecond, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!); we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n\nRegardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n\nWith the great start and participation in January, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in February every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks instead. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target booking_status. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,booking_status\n42100,0\n42101,1\n42102,0\n```\netc.\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Reservation Cancellation Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles\n- train.csv - the training dataset; booking_status is the target (e.g., whether the reservation was cancelled).\n- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict booking_status.\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n\nFirst, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n\nSecond, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n\nRegardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly lightweight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n\nTo start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly lightweight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File\nFor each EmployeeNumber in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable Attrition. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nEmployeeNumber, Attrition\n1677, 0.78\n1678, 0.34\n1679, 0.55\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on Employee Attrition. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nFiles\n- train.csv - the training dataset; Attrition is the binary target\n- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of positive Attrition\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the training and test datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the training dataset\ntrain_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the test dataset\ntest_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the training dataset\ntrain_df.isnull().sum()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the test dataset\ntest_df.isnull().sum()\n```\n```python\n# Check the distribution of the target variable in the training dataset\ntrain_df['Attrition'].value_counts(normalize=True)\n```\nTime consumed: 0.07s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n     id  Age     BusinessTravel  DailyRate              Department  \\\n0   163   27  Travel_Frequently       1302  Research & Development   \n1   427   32      Travel_Rarely       1476  Research & Development   \n2  1239   44      Travel_Rarely       1275  Research & Development   \n3   266   46      Travel_Rarely       1320                   Sales   \n4   148   42      Travel_Rarely        442  Research & Development   \n\n   DistanceFromHome  Education EducationField  EmployeeCount  \\\n0                 2          2  Life Sciences              1   \n1                28          2  Life Sciences              1   \n2                 9          2        Medical              1   \n3                24          4      Marketing              1   \n4                 1          4  Life Sciences              1   \n\n   EnvironmentSatisfaction  ...

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n\nFirst, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n\nSecond, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n\nRegardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same—to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly lightweight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n\nTo start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly lightweight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target Class. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nid,Class\n341588,0.23\n341589,0.92\n341590,0.02\netc.\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Credit Card Fraud Detection. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.\n\nNote, this base dataset for this competition was much larger than previous Tabular Tuesdays datasets, and thus may contain more artifacts than the last three competitions.\n\nFiles\n- train.csv - the training dataset; Class is the target\n- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict Class\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

{"id": 65, "name": "lmsys-chatbot-arena", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are rapidly entering our lives, but ensuring their responses resonate with users is critical for successful interaction. This competition presents a unique opportunity to tackle this challenge with real-world data and help us bridge the gap between LLM capability and human preference.\n\nWe utilized a large dataset collected from Chatbot Arena, where users chat with two anonymous LLMs and choose the answer they prefer. Your task in this competition is to predict which response a user will prefer in these head-to-head battles.\n\nThis challenge aligns with the concept of \"reward models\" or \"preference models\" in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Previous research has identified limitations in directly prompting an existing LLM for preference predictions. These limitations often stem from biases such as favoring responses presented first (position bias), being overly verbose (verbosity bias), or exhibiting self-promotion (self-enhancement bias).\n\nWe encourage you to explore various machine-learning techniques to build a model that can effectively predict user preferences. Your work will be instrumental in developing LLMs that can tailor responses to individual user preferences, ultimately leading to more user-friendly and widely accepted AI-powered conversation systems.\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the log loss between the predicted probabilities and the ground truth values (with \"eps=auto\").\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for each target class. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nid,winner_model_a,winner_model_b,winner_tie\n136060,0.33,0.33,0.33\n211333,0.33,0.33,0.33\n1233961,0.33,0.33,0.33\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nThe competition dataset consists of user interactions from the ChatBot Arena. In each user interaction, a judge provides one or more prompts to two different large language models and then indicates which of the models gave the more satisfactory response. The goal of the competition is to predict the preferences of the judges and determine the likelihood that a given prompt/response pair is selected as the winner.\n\nPlease note that this is a Code Competition. When your submission is scored, this example test data will be replaced with the full test set. There are 55K rows in the training data, and you can expect roughly 25,000 rows in the test set.\n\nFiles\n\ntrain.csv\n- id: A unique identifier for the row.\n- model_[a/b]: The identity of model_[a/b]. Included in train.csv but not test.csv.\n- prompt: The prompt that was given as an input (to both models).\n- response_[a/b]: The response from model_[a/b] to the given prompt.\n- winner_model_[a/b/tie]: Binary columns marking the judge's selection.

Those questions are drawn from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe Challenge\n\nKaggle is launching two companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between March 25 and April 22 by region, the primary goal isn't to produce accurate forecasts. It’s to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19. You are encouraged to pull in, curate, and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your findings in a notebook. \n\nAs the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n\nCompanies and Organizations\n\nThere is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle's dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nJHU CSSE for making the data available to the public. The White House OSTP for pulling together the key open questions. The image comes from the Center for Disease Control.\n\nThis is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n\nEvaluation\n\nPublic and Private Leaderboards\n\nTo have a public leaderboard for this forecasting task, we will be using data from 7 days before to 7 days after the competition launch. Only use data on or prior to 2020-03-11 for predictions on the public leaderboard period. Use up to and including the most recent data for predictions on the private leaderboard period.\n\nPublic Leaderboard Period: 2020-03-12 - 2020-03-25\nPrivate Leaderboard Period: 2020-03-26 - 2020-04-23\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated using the column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE). The RMSLE for a single column is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{RMSLE} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\log(p_i + 1) - \\log(a_i + 1))^2 } \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of observations\n- \\( p_i \\) is your prediction\n- \\( a_i \\) is the actual value\n- \\( \\log(x) \\) is the natural logarithm of \\( x \\)\n\nThe final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns (in this case, 2).\n\nSubmission File\n\nWe understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.\n\nFor each ForecastId in the test set, you'll predict the cumulative COVID-19 cases and fatalities to date. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nForecastId,ConfirmedCases,Fatalities\n1,10,0\n2,10,0\n3,10,0\n```\n\nYou will get the ForecastId for the corresponding date and location from the test.csv file.\n\nDataset Description\n\nIn this challenge, you will be predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in various locations across the world, as well as the number of resulting fatalities for future dates. \n\nWe understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.\n\nFiles\n\n- train.csv - the training data up to Mar 18, 2020.\n- test.csv - the dates to predict; there is a week of overlap with the training data for the initial public leaderboard. Once submissions are paused, the public leaderboard will update based on the last 28 days of predicted data.\n- submission.csv - a sample submission in the correct format; again, predictions should be cumulative.\n\nData Source\n\nThe evaluation data for this competition comes from Johns Hopkins CSSE, which is uninvolved in the competition. See their README for a description of how the data was collected. They are currently updating the data daily.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the training and test datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the training dataset\ntrain_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the test dataset\ntest_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the training dataset\ntrain_df.isnull().sum()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the test dataset\ntest_df.isnull().sum()\n```\nTime consumed: 0.08s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n   ForecastId Province/State Country/Region      Lat      Long        Date  \\\n0       25141      Wisconsin             US  44.2685  -89.6165  2020-02-21   \n1       16498            NaN    Philippines  13.0000  122.0000  2020-02-27   \n2       10192            NaN  French Guiana   3.9339  -53.1258  2020-03-16   \n3        1796            NaN        Bahrain  26.0275   50.5500  2020-02-19   \n4       22993     New Jersey             US  40.2989  -74.5210  2020-02-12   \n\n   ConfirmedCases  Fatalities  \n0             0.0         0.0  \n1             3.0         1.0  \n2             0.0         0.0  \n3             0.0         0.0  \n4             0.0         0.0  \nTime consumed: 0.06s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n   ForecastId Province/State       Country/Region      Lat      Long  \\\n0         411            NaN  Antigua and Barbuda  17.0608  -61.7964   \n1        5982        Jiangxi                China  27.6140  115.7221   \n2        5628          Hubei                China  30.9756  112.2707   \n3       15843            NaN      North Macedonia  41.6086   21.7453   \n4       23556       Oklahoma                   US  35.5653  -96.9289   \n\n         Date  \n0  2020-02-29  \n1  2020-02-20  \n2  2020-03-09  \n3  2020-02-23  \n4  2020-02-17  \nTime consumed: 0.07s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 14313 entries, 0 to 14312\nData columns (total 8 columns):\n #   Column          Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------          --------------  -----  \n 0   ForecastId      14313 non-null  int64  \n 1   Province/State  6600 non-null   object \n 2   Country/Region  14313 non-null  object \n 3   Lat             14313 non-null  float64\n 4   Long            14313 non-null  float64\n 5   Date            14313 non-null  object \n 6   ConfirmedCases  14313 non-null  float64\n 7   Fatalities      14313 non-null  float64\ndtypes: float64(4), int64(1), object(3)\nmemory usage: 894.7+ KB\n\nTime consumed: 0.06s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 3579 entries, 0 to 3578\nData columns (total 6 columns):\n #   Column          Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------          --------------  -----  \n 0   ForecastId      3579 non-null   int64  \n 1   Province/State  1590 non-null   object \n 2   Country/Region  3579 non-null   object \n 3   Lat             3579 non-null   float64\n 4   Long            3579 non-null   float64\n 5   Date            3579 non-null   object \ndtypes: float64(2), int64(1), object(3)\nmemory usage: 167.9+ KB\n\nTime consumed: 0.07s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \nForecastId           0\nProvince/State    7713\nCountry/Region       0\nLat                  0\nLong                 0\nDate                 0\nConfirmedCases       0\nFatalities           0\ndtype: int64\nTime consumed: 0.06s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \nForecastId           0\nProvince/State    1989\nCountry/Region       0\nLat                  0\nLong                 0\nDate                 0\ndtype: int64\n```markdown\nThe datasets have been successfully loaded and explored.

{"id": 68, "name": "covid19-global-forecasting-week-4", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nThis is week 4 of Kaggle's COVID-19 forecasting series, following the Week 3 competition. This is the 4th competition we've launched in this series. All of the prior discussion forums have been migrated to this competition for continuity.\n\nBackground\n\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition of research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe Challenge\n\nKaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenge to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 15 and May 14 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.\n\nYou are encouraged to pull in, curate, and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your findings in a notebook.\n\nAs the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).\n\nWe have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n\nCompanies and Organizations\n\nThere is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle’s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nJHU CSSE for making the data available to the public. The White House OSTP for pulling together the key open questions. The image comes from the Center for Disease Control.\n\nThis is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n\nEvaluation\n\nPublic and Private Leaderboard\n\nTo have a public leaderboard for this forecasting task, we will be using data from 7 days before to 7 days after the competition launch. Only use data prior to 2020-04-01 for predictions on the public leaderboard period. Use up to and including the most recent data for predictions on the private leaderboard period.\n\nPublic Leaderboard Period - 2020-04-01 to 2020-04-15\nPrivate Leaderboard Period - 2020-04-16 to 2020-05-14\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated using the column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error. The RMSLE for a single column is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\log(p_i + 1) - \\log(a_i + 1))^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(n\\) is the total number of observations\n- \\(p_i\\) is your prediction\n- \\(a_i\\) is the actual value \n- \\(\\log(x)\\) is the natural logarithm of \\(x\\)\n\nThe final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns (in this case, 2).\n\nSubmission File\n\nWe understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.\n\nFor each ForecastId in the test set, you'll predict the cumulative COVID-19 cases and fatalities to date. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nForecastId,ConfirmedCases,Fatalities\n1,10,0\n2,10,0\n3,10,0\netc.\n```\nYou will get the ForecastId for the corresponding date and location from the test.csv file.\n\nDataset Description\n\nIn this challenge, you will be predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in various locations across the world, as well as the number of resulting fatalities, for future dates. We understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.\n\nFiles\n- train.csv - the training data (you are encouraged to join in many more useful external datasets)\n- test.csv - the dates to predict; there is a week of overlap with the training data for the initial Public leaderboard. Once submissions are paused, the Public leaderboard will update based on the last 28 days of predicted data.\n- submission.csv - a sample submission in the correct format; again, predictions should be cumulative.\n\nData Source\n\nThe evaluation data for this competition comes from John Hopkins CSSE, which is uninvolved in the competition. See their README for a description of how the data was collected. They are currently updating the data daily.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the training and test datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the training dataset\ntrain_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check the structure and data types of the test dataset\ntest_df.info()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the training dataset\ntrain_df.isnull().sum()\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the test dataset\ntest_df.isnull().sum()\n```\nTime consumed: 0.09s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n   ForecastId Province_State Country_Region        Date  ConfirmedCases  \\\n0       24970            NaN       Slovakia  2020-02-05             0.0   \n1       19249            NaN       Malaysia  2020-03-05            50.0   \n2        7758          Hubei          China  2020-03-14         67790.0   \n3       29787  Massachusetts             US  2020-01-23             0.0   \n4       10602            NaN        Croatia  2020-02-12             0.0   \n\n   Fatalities  \n0         0.0  \n1         0.0  \n2      3075.0  \n3         0.0  \n4         0.0  \nTime consumed: 0.05s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n   ForecastId        Province_State Country_Region        Date\n0       28261  District of Columbia             US  2020-04-16\n1       22844                   NaN           Peru  2020-04-04\n2        3736                   NaN       Bulgaria  2020-03-17\n3       27646              Arkansas             US  2020-03-07\n4       15493                   NaN         Guyana  2020-04-13\nTime consumed: 0.08s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 28796 entries, 0 to 28795\nData columns (total 6 columns):\n #

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nThis competition is provided as a way to explore different time series techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset. You are given 5 years of store-item sales data and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores. \n\nWhat's the best way to deal with seasonality? Should stores be modeled separately, or can you pool them together? Does deep learning work better than ARIMA? Can either beat xgboost? This is a great competition to explore different models and improve your skills in forecasting.\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values. We define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.\n\nKernel Submissions  \nYou can only make submissions directly from Kaggle Kernels. By adding your teammates as collaborators on a kernel, you can share and edit code privately with them.\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the sales variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \nid,sales  \n0,35  \n1,22  \n2,5  \netc.\n\nDataset Description  \nThe objective of this competition is to predict 3 months of item-level sales data at different store locations.\n\nFile descriptions  \ntrain.csv  \n- Training data  \ntest.csv  \n- Test data (Note: the Public/Private split is time based)  \nsample_submission.csv  \n- A sample submission file in the correct format  \n\nData fields  \ndate  \n- Date of the sale data.

You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nThis week 3 forecasting task is now closed for submissions. Click here to visit the week 4 version and make a submission there. This is week 3 of Kaggle's COVID-19 forecasting series, following the Week 2 competition. This is the 3rd of at least 4 competitions we plan to launch in this series. All of the prior discussion forums have been migrated to this competition for continuity.\n\nBackground  \nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition of research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe Challenge  \nKaggle is launching companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19. You are encouraged to pull in, curate, and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your findings in a notebook. As the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n\nCompanies and Organizations  \nThere is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle’s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n\nAcknowledgements  \nJHU CSSE for making the data available to the public. The White House OSTP for pulling together the key open questions. The image comes from the Center for Disease Control. This is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n\nEvaluation  \nPublic and Private Leaderboard  \nTo have a public leaderboard for this forecasting task, we will be using data from 7 days before to 7 days after competition launch. Only use data prior to 2020-03-26 for predictions on the public leaderboard period. Use up to and including the most recent data for predictions on the private leaderboard period. Public Leaderboard Period - 2020-03-26 - 2020-04-08 Private Leaderboard Period - 2020-04-09 - 2020-05-07 \n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated using the column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE). The RMSLE for a single column is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\log(p_i + 1) - \\log(a_i + 1))^2 } \\]\n\nwhere:  \n\\( n \\) is the total number of observations  \n\\( p_i \\) is your prediction  \n\\( a_i \\) is the actual value  \n\\( \\log(x) \\) is the natural logarithm of \\( x \\)\n\nThe final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns (in this case, 2).\n\nSubmission File  \nWe understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.\n\nFor each ForecastId in the test set, you'll predict the cumulative COVID-19 cases and fatalities to date. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  \n`ForecastId,ConfirmedCases,Fatalities`  \n`1,10,0`  \n`2,10,0`  \n`3,10,0`  \netc.  \n\nYou will get the ForecastId for the corresponding date and location from the test.csv file.\n\nDataset Description  \nIn this challenge, you will be predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in various locations across the world, as well as the number of resulting fatalities, for future dates. We understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.\n\nFiles  \n- train.csv: the training data (you are encouraged to join in many more useful external datasets)\n- test.csv: the dates to predict; there is a week of overlap with the training data for the initial Public leaderboard. Once submissions are paused, the Public leaderboard will update based on the last 28 days of predicted data.\n- submission.csv: a sample submission in the correct format; again, predictions should be cumulative.\n\nData Source  \nThis evaluation data for this competition comes from Johns Hopkins CSSE, which is uninvolved in the competition. See their README for a description of how the data was collected. They are currently updating the data daily.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file.

{"id": 72, "name": "covid19-global-forecasting-week-2", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription  \nThis week 2 forecasting task is now closed for submissions. Click here to visit the week 3 version, and make a submission there.  \nThis is week 2 of Kaggle's COVID-19 forecasting series, following the Week 1 competition. This is the 2nd of at least 4 competitions we plan to launch in this series.\n\nBackground  \nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition of research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe Challenge  \nKaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenge to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.  \nYou are encouraged to pull in, curate, and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your findings in a notebook.  \nAs the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).  \nWe have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n\nCompanies and Organizations  \nThere is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle’s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.\n\nAcknowledgements  \nJHU CSSE for making the data available to the public. The White House OSTP for pulling together the key open questions. The image comes from the Center for Disease Control.  \nThis is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n\nEvaluation  \nPublic and Private Leaderboard  \nTo have a public leaderboard for this forecasting task, we will be using data from 7 days before to 7 days after the competition launch. Only use data prior to 2020-03-19 for predictions on the public leaderboard period. Use up to and including the most recent data for predictions on the private leaderboard period.  \nPublic Leaderboard Period: 2020-03-19 - 2020-04-01  \nPrivate Leaderboard Period: 2020-04-02 - 2020-04-30  \nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated using the column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE).  \nThe RMSLE for a single column is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\log(p_i + 1) - \\log(a_i + 1))^2 }\n\\]\n\nwhere:  \n\\(n\\) is the total number of observations  \n\\(p_i\\) is your prediction  \n\\(a_i\\) is the actual value  \n\\(\\log(x)\\) is the natural logarithm of \\(x\\)  \nThe final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns (in this case, 2).\n\nSubmission File  \nWe understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.  \nFor each ForecastId in the test set, you'll predict the cumulative COVID-19 cases and fatalities to date. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nForecastId,ConfirmedCases,Fatalities\n1,10,0\n2,10,0\n3,10,0\n```\netc.  \nYou will get the ForecastId for the corresponding date and location from the test.csv file.\n\nDataset Description  \nIn this challenge, you will be predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in various locations across the world, as well as the number of resulting fatalities, for future dates.  \nWe understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.  \n\nFiles  \n- train.csv - the training data (you are encouraged to join in many more useful external datasets)\n- test.csv - the dates to predict; there is a week of overlap with the training data for the initial Public leaderboard. Once submissions are paused, the Public leaderboard will update based on the last 28 days of predicted data.\n- submission.csv - a sample submission in the correct format; again, predictions should be cumulative.\n\nData Source  \nThis evaluation data for this competition comes from Johns Hopkins CSSE, which is uninvolved in the competition.  \nSee their README for a description of how the data was collected.

{"id": 73, "name": "conways-reverse-game-of-life-2020", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription \nThis is a relaunch of a previous competition, Conway's Reverse Game of Life, with the following changes:\n- The grid size is larger (25 vs. 25) and the grid wraps around from top to bottom and left to right.\n- Submissions are solved forward by the appropriate number of steps so that any correct starting solution will achieve a maximum score.\n\nThis article contains the stepping function that is used for this competition.\n\nObligatory Disclaimer: A lot has changed since the original competition was launched 6 years ago. With the change from \"exact starting point\" to \"any correct starting point\", it is possible to get a perfect score. We just don't know how difficult that will be. Use it as a fun learning experience, and don't spoil it for others by posting perfect solutions!\n\nThe Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. The game consists of a board of cells that are either on or off. One creates an initial configuration of these on/off states and observes how it evolves. There are four simple rules to determine the next state of the game board, given the current state:\n- Overpopulation: If a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies.\n- Stasis: If a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives.\n- Underpopulation: If a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies.\n- Reproduction: If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it becomes a live cell.\n\nThese simple rules result in many interesting behaviors and have been the focus of a large body of mathematics. As Wikipedia states:\n\n\"Ever since its publication, Conway's Game of Life has attracted much interest because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. Life provides an example of emergence and self-organization. It is interesting for computer scientists, physicists, biologists, biochemists, economists, mathematicians, philosophers, generative scientists, and others to observe the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of very simple rules. The game can also serve as a didactic analogy, used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that 'design' and 'organization' can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett has used the analogue of Conway's Life 'universe' extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as consciousness and free will, from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws governing our own universe.\"\n\nThe emergence of order from simple rules begs an interesting question—what happens if we set time backwards?\n\nThis competition is an experiment to see if machine learning (or optimization, or any method) can predict the game of life in reverse. Is the chaotic start of Life predictable from its orderly ends? We have created many games, evolved them, and provided only the end boards. You are asked to predict the starting board that resulted in each end board.\n\nThis is a Code Competition. Refer to Code Requirements for details.\n\nEvaluation \nYou are evaluated on the mean absolute error of your predictions, stepped forward by the specified steps, and compared to the provided ending solution. In this case, this is equivalent to 1 − classification accuracy across all of the cells. You may only predict 0 (dead) or 1 (alive) for each cell.\n\nSubmission File \nFor every game in the test set, your submission file should list the predicted starting board on a single row. Values are listed in a row-wise order. That is, if you want to predict a matrix:\n```\n1 2 3 4\n```\nthe predicted row would be `(1,2,3,4)`. The submission file should contain a header and have the following format:\n```\nid, start_0, start_1, start_2, ..., start_624\n50000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0\n50001, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0\n...\n```\n\nDataset Description \nWe have provided 50,000 training games and 50,000 test games, whose starting board you must predict. Each board is 25x25, for a total of 625 cells per board. Values are listed in a row-wise order. You are free to create more training games if you desire.\n\nThe provided variables are:\n- id: unique identifier of each game\n- delta: the number of steps between the start and stop boards\n- start_0: row 1, column 1 of the game's starting board\n- start_1: row 1, column 2 of the game's starting board\n…\n- stop_0: row 1, column 1 of the game's stopping board\n…\n\nYour test-set predictions should be the starting board at delta steps before the stopping board. The games were created by the following procedure:\n1. An initial board was chosen by filling the board with a random density between 1% full (mostly zeros) and 99% full (mostly ones).\n2. This initial board was evolved 5 steps. The starting board's state was recorded after the 5 \"warmup steps\". These are the values in the start variables.\n3. The starting board was then evolved delta steps. Delta was chosen to be uniformly random between 1 and 5. If the stopping board was empty, the game was discarded. The stopping board's state was then recorded. These are the values in the stop variables.\n\nFAQs \nWhy the need for warmup steps? The transition from an initial random board to the second step can be quite \"nonlinear\" and dramatic. For example, if a board is mostly alive at the first step, it will be mostly dead on the second. We allow the game to warm up for five steps in order to let the cells calm down and settle into a more \"life-like\" state.\n\nThe Game of Life loses information over time. What gives? Correct, this is a many-to-one problem (many starting states can lead to the same stopping state). For example, many boards that are sparse at the start will end up in the same state (and you will see this in the data). However, over short time scales we expect this to be a minor issue. The largest step back in time in this competition is 5, which we hope is not so far that the degeneracy becomes an issue.\n\nCan I predict any valid state? Yes. Any starting state that achieves the ending state will achieve an optimal score.\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and

{"id": 67, "name": "see-click-predict-fix", "input_text": "I have a data modeling task. You must give me the predicted results as a CSV file as detailed in the following content. You should try your best to predict the answer. I provide you with three files. One is training data, one is test data. There is also a sample file for submission.\nDescription\n\nThis competition is the successor to the See Click Predict Fix Hackathon. The purpose of both competitions is to quantify and predict how people will react to a specific 311 issue. What makes an issue urgent? What do citizens really care about? How much does location matter? Being able to predict the most pressing 311 topics will allow governments to focus their efforts on fixing the most important problems. The data set for the competitions contains several hundred thousand 311 issues from four cities.\n\nFor those who are more interested in using the data for visualization or \"non-predictive\" data mining, we have added a $500 visualization prize. You may submit as many entries as you wish via the Visualization page. If you're plotting issues on maps, displaying the text in some meaningful way, or making any other creative use of the data, save it and post it!\n\nAbout 311\n\n311 is a mechanism by which citizens can express their desire to solve a problem in the city or government by submitting a description of what needs to be done, fixed, or changed. In effect, this provides a high degree of transparency between government and its constituents. Once an issue has been established, citizens can vote and make comments on the issue so that government officials have some degree of awareness about what is the most important issue to address.\n\nSponsors\n\nThe meeting space has been provided by Microsoft. Prize money is graciously offered by our sponsors:\n\nOn the citizen side, SeeClickFix leverages crowdsourcing to help both maintain the flow of incoming requests and show the public how effective you can be. When anyone in the community can report or comment on any issue, the entire group has a better perspective on what's happening—and how to fix it effectively.\n\nFor governments, SeeClickFix acts as a completely customizable CRM that plugs into your existing request management tools. From types of service requests to managing different watch areas, SeeClickFix helps better maintain and fulfill 311 requests in your city.\n\nA public policy entrepreneur and open innovation expert, David advises numerous governments on open government and open data and works with leading non-profits and businesses on strategy, open innovation, and community management. In addition to his work, David is an affiliate with the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard where he is looking at issues surrounding the politics of data. You can find David's writing on open innovation, public policy, public sector renewal, and open source systems at his blog, or at TechPresident. In addition to his writing, David is frequently invited to speak on open government, policy making, negotiation, and strategy to executives, policymakers, and students.\n\nYou can read a background on how this challenge came to be here.\n\nEvaluation\n\nYour model should predict, for each issue in the test set, the number of views, votes, and comments. We will use the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) to measure the accuracy. The RMSLE is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{RMSLE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\log(p_i + 1) - \\log(a_i + 1))^2 }\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(n\\) is three times the total number of issues in the test set (summing over each of views, votes, and comments for each issue)\n- \\(p_i\\) is your predicted value\n- \\(a_i\\) is the actual value\n- \\(\\log(x)\\) is the natural logarithm\n\nSubmission Format\n\nYour submission file must have a header and should be structured in the following format:\n\n```\nid,num_views,num_votes,num_comments\n343272,0,0,0\n274860,0,0,0\n43608,0,0,0\n```\n\nDataset Description\n\nYou are provided with 311 issues from four cities covering the time period since 2012. The goal of the contest is to predict the number of views, votes, and comments that a given issue has received to date. The training set contains the 311 data with the three target variables. The test set contains just the 311 data.\n\nWhile we have done a small amount of data cleaning, this is largely raw data from SeeClickFix. It will contain noise! Expect to find repeated issues, incomplete descriptions, and any number of data quality hurdles. Among the unique challenges of this data set:\n- SeeClickFix is dynamically evolving—adding users, incorporating new input sources, and changing how it is structured. Your predictions may be affected by global influences outside the issues themselves.\n- Communities are dynamically evolving as well, as are the governments responding to the issues.\n- Older 311 issues leave more time for people to view, vote, and comment, but those solved quickly become less relevant.\n- The data is coming from many different inputs, which may result in systematic differences in the response to the issues.\n\nData Dictionary\n\n- id: a randomly assigned id\n- latitude: the latitude of the issue\n- longitude: the longitude of the issue\n- summary: a short text title\n- description: a longer text explanation\n- num_votes: the number of user-generated votes\n- num_comments: the number of user-generated comments\n- num_views: the number of views\n- source: a categorical variable indicating where the issue was created\n- created_time: the time the issue originated\n- tag_type: a categorical variable (assigned automatically) of the type of issue\nAll three data files can be found in the folder `./input/`. **You should use sklearn or pytorch to complete the task.** Any training scripts, models, and experiment log should be saved in `./input/`. After data modeling, provide the prediction results for the test file in the format specified by the sample submission file. Save the final submission to `./input/final_submission.csv`.\n        ", "response": "```markdown\n[STEP GOAL]: Load and explore the training and test datasets to understand their structure and contents.\n```\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the training and test datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('./input/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('./input/test.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the training dataset\ntrain_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Display the first few rows of the test dataset\ntest_df.head()\n```\n```python\n# Check the shape of the datasets to understand the number of rows and columns\ntrain_shape = train_df.shape\ntest_shape = test_df.shape\n\ntrain_shape, test_shape\n```\n```python\n# Check for missing values in the training dataset\ntrain_missing_values = train_df.isnull().sum()\n\n# Check for missing values in the test dataset\ntest_missing_values = test_df.isnull().sum()\n\ntrain_missing_values, test_missing_values\n```\n```python\n# Display basic statistics of the training dataset\ntrain_df.describe()\n```\n```python\n# Display basic statistics of the test dataset\ntest_df.describe()\n```\nTime consumed: 0.51s\nCode output:\nExit Code: 0\nOutput: \n       id   latitude   longitude                         summary  \\\n0  399932  41.910216  -87.697180                Graffiti Removal   \n1  256363  41.927096  -87.704182                Graffiti Removal   \n2   28025  41.897329  -87.758114            Street Light 1 / Out   \n3  285315  37.799274 -122.251373                 Illegal Dumping   \n4  136959  41.946930  -87.673380  Rodent Baiting / Rat Complaint   \n\n                                         description  num_votes  num_comments  \\\n0                                 Graffiti - Painted          1             0   \n1                                 Graffiti - Painted          1             0   \n2                                                NaN          1             0   \n3  Furniture, car parts, mattresses, clothes, ant...          5             0   \n4                              Completed.
